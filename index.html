		<p>A long, long time ago, there lived a boy so small and thin that everyone called him Little Thumb. He had six older brothers, who were also just as skinny as Little Thumb, because their parents were so poor that they couldn&rsquo;t afford enough food for them. The father was a woodcutter, but no one bought his wood since everyone in the area was just as poor.</p>
		<p>One night, Little Thumb&rsquo;s stomach growled so loudly that he couldn&rsquo;t sleep. He snuck downstairs to see if he could find a few crumbs of bread. In the kitchen, he overheard his father sighing, &ldquo;Wife, we&rsquo;re completely out of food. There&rsquo;s no other choice. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll take the children to the forest and leave them there.&rdquo; Little Thumb couldn&rsquo;t believe his ears&mdash;who would do something so terrible? But that&rsquo;s how things go in fairy tales.</p>
		<p>Little though he was, he was also very clever, and he quickly came up with a plan. He snuck outside and filled his pockets with pebbles. The next day, his father said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to the forest.&rdquo; So, off they went, one after the other in a long line, with the father leading and Little Thumb at the very end. Every five steps, he secretly dropped a pebble. When they reached a stream, the father stopped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut wood on the other side. You stay here and play, and I&rsquo;ll come back to get you later.&rdquo;When the sun had set and the father still hadn&rsquo;t returned, the brothers began to cry. Little Thumb said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know the way home.&rdquo; And he did, for he simply followed the pebbles he had dropped along the way.The father and mother were very happy to see them because that day the father had managed to sell some wood, and there was bread in the house once again.</p>
		<p>But after a while, things went wrong again. No one bought wood from the woodcutter, and once again, they all sat around the table with empty plates. So, the next day, the father took the children to the forest once more, and again, Little Thumb had filled his pockets with pebbles, which he dropped along the way. Once again, he found his way home in the evening. By chance, the father had earned a little money that day, and everyone was happy again.</p>
		<p>But even this happiness didn&rsquo;t last long. One day, there was only half a loaf of bread in the house, which was far too little for nine people. Little Thumb knew what he had to do, but when he tried to gather pebbles from the yard that night, he discovered to his dismay that the door was locked! The next day, the father divided the half loaf into seven pieces, one for each child, and led his sons into the forest once again. This time, instead of pebbles, Little Thumb dropped breadcrumbs every five steps. When it got dark, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think father is coming back. Let&rsquo;s head home; the breadcrumbs will show us the way.&rdquo; But guess what? Birds and mice had eaten the breadcrumbs. There they stood! How would they find their way home?</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here all night,&rdquo; said Little Thumb. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to find our own way back.&rdquo; But they got lost and wandered deeper into the forest, farther and farther from home. The brothers grew tired and started to blame Little Thumb, but he kept his spirits up. He climbed a tall tree, hoping to spot their house. Though he couldn&rsquo;t see it, he did see a light in the distance. Maybe they could find something to eat there because they were all starving! They reached a large, tall house, much bigger than their own. Little Thumb knocked on the door. A kind woman opened it. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, do you have some food for us and perhaps a place to sleep?&rdquo; Little Thumb asked politely. &ldquo;Oh, poor children!&rdquo; said the woman, shocked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that a giant lives here, one who loves human flesh?&rdquo; She thought for a moment. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t send you back into the forest, it&rsquo;s completely dark now. You know what? There&rsquo;s an extra bed in the room next to where his seven daughters sleep. You can spend the night there. But you&rsquo;ll have to be very quiet because the giant must not know you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; She gave them each a bowl of soup. &ldquo;Eat quickly because the giant could return any moment!&rdquo; Hardly had she said this when the house began to shake. The woman jumped up and whispered urgently, &ldquo;The giant is coming back with his seven-league boots. With those magical boots, he can take strides as long as a football field. Quickly, upstairs!&rdquo; Tripping over each other, Little Thumb and his brothers hurried up the steep stairs, following the woman. She led them into a room. &ldquo;Get in bed, and remember: not a peep! His daughters are sleeping next door, and the giant mustn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo; She turned and went downstairs to let the giant in. Little Thumb and his brothers climbed into the large bed and held their breath. They heard the giant come in&mdash;or rather, they felt it, as the whole house shook. &ldquo;What do I smell?&rdquo; they heard him say. &ldquo;Do I smell human flesh?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the woman replied nervously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining things.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Little Thumb quietly got out of bed and snuck over to the room where the giant&rsquo;s daughters were sleeping. They lay in one big bed, each wearing a small crown. Gently, Little Thumb took their crowns and crept back to his brothers. &ldquo;Put these crowns on!&rdquo; he whispered, and before hiding under the blanket, he put one on his own head.</p>
		<p>A bit later, the giant stomped up the stairs. &ldquo;And yet I smell human flesh,&rdquo; he muttered as he entered the room where Little Thumb and his brothers lay. In the dark, he felt the crowns and assumed they were his daughters. Still not completely sure, he went into the next room. &ldquo;See? I did smell human flesh,&rdquo; he said, feeling a head of hair and then, one by one, ate all his seven daughters, clothes and all, so quickly that they didn&rsquo;t even wake up! The giant flopped onto his bed, and soon he was snoring so loudly it sounded like a huge tree being felled.</p>
		<p>Little Thumb and his brothers quietly got out of bed and tiptoed down the stairs. In a corner of the kitchen lay the seven-league boots. Without hesitation, Little Thumb put them on, and, wonder of wonders, they fit perfectly! After all, they were magical boots. He grabbed his oldest brother&rsquo;s hand, who held the next brother&rsquo;s, and so on, and they strode in a line through the forest. When the sun rose, Little Thumb saw a house in the distance. &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;re home!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Their father and mother were overjoyed to see their children again, and to find that Little Thumb had cleverly brought back the seven golden crowns. They sold them, and from then on, they always had enough money for food. And never again did the father have to leave his children in the forest. Yes, that&rsquo;s how things go in fairy tales.</p>

		<p>A long, long time ago, there was an emperor who was incredibly vain. Now, everyone is a little vain, but this emperor loved looking in the mirror way too much&mdash;and, on top of that, he was quite foolish. Just listen.</p>
		<p>The emperor in this story did nothing but try on new clothes all day. In fact, he thought about nothing but clothes. He had twelve huge closets, all completely full, and mirrors were everywhere in his palace. Each hallway had at least three, the dining room had eight, and the grand salon had ten&mdash;let alone the bedroom. There was a giant mirror fastened to the ceiling so that he could look at himself even while lying in bed. As you can imagine, he spent a lot of time lying on his back.</p>
		<p>Everyone in the land talked about how vain the emperor was. Two strangers who happened to be traveling through the country and were out of money heard about this. They came up with a clever plan to make a lot of money easily.</p>
		<p>They went to the palace and told the emperor they could make clothes that were not only beautiful but also very special. The emperor sat up straight immediately&mdash;he had to have those clothes! &ldquo;How so, special?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Only smart people can see the clothes,&rdquo; explained the men. &ldquo;For foolish people, they&rsquo;re invisible.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>These clothes are not only beautiful and special, thought the emperor, but also very useful because now I&rsquo;ll know who is foolish and who isn&rsquo;t. And you can see that the emperor himself wasn&rsquo;t very bright because who would believe such a thing? The emperor ordered the two liars to start immediately, as in two weeks, there would be a grand parade through the city, and he wanted to lead it in his new clothes. He showed them to a large room where they could set up their looms. The two men asked the emperor for heaps of money to buy the finest, most luxurious, and therefore the most expensive threads. But they kept the money for themselves. They didn&rsquo;t buy anything. Day after day, they sat at the looms, pretending to string threads, pretending to weave, pretending to pull the finest fabrics off the looms, and pretending to make the most beautiful clothes from these fabrics. But there were no fabrics, there were no clothes&mdash;there was nothing at all.</p>
		<p>Of course, the emperor was very curious about how the clothes looked. He sent his chief minister to check. One of the men showed him in and pointed to the empty looms and the bare tables. &ldquo;Just look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you see how beautifully the fabric shines? And do you see how splendid the clothes on the table turned out?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The chief minister looked at the empty looms and the empty tables and thought, Oh dear, I must be foolish because I don&rsquo;t see any clothes. But he didn&rsquo;t say this out loud because he didn&rsquo;t want everyone to know he was foolish. So he said, &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes! They&rsquo;re truly magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And when the emperor later asked how the clothes were, the chief minister again said they were magnificent. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; the emperor thought to himself. &ldquo;This minister isn&rsquo;t foolish, for he can see the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Everyone in the land heard about the two marvelous tailors, and everyone talked about the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes. The emperor grew more and more curious, but he had to wait until the day of the big parade. Only then would he finally be allowed to admire his new clothes.</p>
		<p>With all his ministers in a line behind him, he went to the room of the two fraudsters. Of course, the emperor couldn&rsquo;t see the clothes. Oh no, he thought, am I foolish too? And naturally, he didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know that either. &ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are truly stunning!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; said all the ministers, who also saw nothing. &ldquo;They are truly stunning!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The emperor then undressed completely to put on his new clothes. The two men pretended to dress him. First, they pretended to put on underwear, then a shirt, pants, a jacket, and the rest of the ensemble. Then they took a step back and looked at the naked emperor from head to toe. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the clothes truly suit you perfectly!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; all the ministers chimed in, &ldquo;the clothes truly suit you perfectly!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Proudly, the emperor walked outside and, stark naked, paraded confidently at the head of the procession. The streets were packed with people, all eager to see the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes, and everyone shouted, &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh, what magnificent clothes!&rdquo; Because no one wanted to appear foolish, of course.</p>
		<p>But suddenly, a little boy called out, &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t wearing any clothes at all!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Startled, the people around the boy looked at him. Then they looked at each other again. And you know what happens when one person dares to tell the truth? Suddenly, others dare to as well. So a moment later, everyone was shouting, &ldquo;The emperor is walking around naked! The emperor is walking around naked!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m not the only foolish one, thought the emperor. He straightened his back and marched even more proudly through the crowd. Completely naked! Can you imagine that?</p>

		<p>A long, long time ago, there was a mother goat who lived with her seven little kids in a cottage at the edge of the forest. Very often, three times a week even, Mother Goat had to go to the village to buy groceries, because seven little goats sure eat a lot! And every time before leaving, she would say, &ldquo;Listen well, children, be careful of the wolf! I don&rsquo;t need to tell you what wolves do to little goats. So lock the door tightly when I&rsquo;m gone. You must only open it for me and no one else. Do you understand?&rdquo; She was so careful! And she was right, just listen...</p>
		<p>One day, Mother Goat had to go shopping again. This time, someone was hiding behind the big tree next to the cottage, watching her until she disappeared around the bend. That &ldquo;someone&rdquo; crept up to the cottage, sniffed around the walls and the windows. You guessed it&mdash;it was the wolf! He knocked on the door and said in his sweetest voice, &ldquo;Open up, my dear little goats, it&rsquo;s your mother.&rdquo; Inside, the kids huddled together in fear and replied, &ldquo;No, no, you don&rsquo;t sound like our mother. Our mother doesn&rsquo;t have such a gruff voice!&rdquo; They squeezed closer together and shivered with fright. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, thought the wolf, I need to speak in a higher voice. He walked back to the big tree, waited a moment, then returned to the door.With a high-pitched voice, he said, &ldquo;Dear little goats, open up, it&rsquo;s your mother.&rdquo; It did sound like their mother, but just to be sure, the kids called out, &ldquo;Then show us your paw under the door!&rdquo; They gasped and shrank back when they saw a brown, furry paw through the crack under the door! &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they cried, trembling with wide eyes, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not our mother! Our mother has white paws!&rdquo; Oh, that&rsquo;s right, thought the wolf. He went to his den and came back with a pot of flour. He dipped a paw in it and then said in a high voice, &ldquo;Dear little goats, open the door! It&rsquo;s your mother.&rdquo; The little goats all gathered by the door and called, &ldquo;Then show us your paw!&rdquo;</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>When they saw the white paw, they opened the door. And they should not have done that&hellip; The wolf sprang inside. The little goats screamed and scattered in every direction. One hid under the table, the second behind the cupboard, the third under the bed, the fourth in the laundry basket, the fifth behind the coat rack, the sixth behind a door, and the seventh in the grandfather clock&hellip; The wolf found them all and gobbled them up right away&mdash;all but one... The only one he missed was the seventh little kid hiding in the clock.</p>
		<p>Not long after, Mother Goat came back. From a distance, she saw that the door was wide open, and when she found the flour pot near the door and couldn&rsquo;t see her kids anywhere, she began to wail in despair. &ldquo;My little ones, my little ones,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;where are you?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The seventh little goat crept out of the clock and told her what had happened. &ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; said Mother Goat, &ldquo;if he ate six of my kids, he must have a very full belly now, and with such a big belly, he won&rsquo;t get far.&rdquo; She took a pair of scissors and a sewing kit and went outside. Flour was scattered everywhere, so she could easily see where the wolf had gone. And sure enough, there he was, sleeping under a tree not too far away.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Look at that big belly of his,&rdquo; Mother Goat said to herself, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where my darlings are.&rdquo; She tiptoed closer and, very quickly, snipped open his belly. The little goats sprang out. Mother Goat filled the wolf&rsquo;s belly with big stones and sewed it up again nice and tight. Then, they all hid behind the trees.</p>
		<p>After a long while, the wolf woke up. I feel so strange in my belly, he thought, and I&rsquo;m so thirsty! He walked to a brook, which was very hard to do with all those stones in his belly, leaned over to drink, fell into the water, and drowned. Mother Goat and her seven little kids jumped up and down with joy&mdash;they were so happy that the wicked wolf was gone. Relieved, they all went home. They took the flour pot with them and made delicious pancakes from it.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time&mdash;long, long ago&mdash;there was a girl named Little Red Riding Hood. That wasn&rsquo;t her real name, but everyone called her that because she always wore a red hood on her head.</p>
		<p>One day, her mother said, &ldquo;Little Red Riding Hood, you need to go visit Grandma. She&rsquo;s sick, and I&rsquo;ve packed a basket with bread rolls, cookies, and a nice bottle of wine for her.&rdquo;Grandma lived in a small cottage in the middle of the forest near the big oak tree. It was quite far, but Little Red Riding Hood knew the way very well. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;walk briskly and don&rsquo;t stray from the path.&rdquo; Little Red Riding Hood promised and set off through the forest, walking at a steady pace.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a big wolf poked his head out from between the trees. Little Red Riding Hood greeted him politely but kept walking briskly. &ldquo;Young lady, young lady,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;why the rush? Where are you going with that basket?&rdquo;&ldquo;To Grandma&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Little Red Riding Hood. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sick.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh? And where does Grandma live?&rdquo; asked the wolf again.&ldquo;Near the big oak tree,&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood, &ldquo;but if you don&rsquo;t mind, I have to go now. Goodbye, Mr. Wolf!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The wolf walked alongside her and said, &ldquo;Oh, come on, don&rsquo;t you see what a beautiful day it is today? And look at all those lovely flowers. I&rsquo;m sure Grandma would be very happy if you brought her a bunch of flowers along with that basket of treats.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>What Little Red Riding Hood didn&rsquo;t know was that the wolf was very hungry, and she looked like a tasty snack to him. But the wolf was greedy. Now that he&rsquo;d heard about Grandma, he wanted both Little Red Riding Hood *and* her grandmother as snacks.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to leave the path,&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood.&ldquo;Oh, come now!&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your Grandma, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And with that, he disappeared among the trees.Little Red Riding Hood paused. The wolf was right; those flowers were beautiful. She forgot her mother&rsquo;s advice and&hellip; wandered off the path.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the wolf dashed through the forest toward the big oak tree. He arrived at Grandma&rsquo;s cottage and stopped outside. &ldquo;Grandma,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Little Red Riding Hood. Will you open the door for me?&rdquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, dear,&rdquo; Grandma called back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in bed. Just pull the string, and the door will open by itself.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The wolf pulled the string, pushed the door open, leapt onto Grandma&rsquo;s bed, and swallowed her in one big gulp. Then he grabbed a nightgown from the closet, put on Grandma&rsquo;s sleeping cap, perched her glasses on his nose, and got under the covers. Now he looked just like Grandma. Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood was already on her way again, now carrying a big bunch of flowers.When she reached Grandma&rsquo;s cottage, she noticed something odd: the door was open. She went inside and walked straight to the bedroom.</p>
		<p>She stared at her Grandma in surprise; something looked a little strange about her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But Grandma, what big ears you have!&rdquo; she cried, astonished.The wolf answered in a high-pitched voice, &ldquo;All the better to hear you with, my dear.&rdquo;&ldquo;But Grandma,&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood again, &ldquo;what a big nose you have!&rdquo;&ldquo;All the better to smell you with, my child,&rdquo; replied the wolf. &ldquo;But Grandma, what big eyes you have!&rdquo; said Little Red Riding Hood, even more surprised. &ldquo;All the better to see you with, my dear,&rdquo; answered the wolf.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But Grandma, what a big mouth you have!&rdquo; Little Red Riding Hood was amazed. &ldquo;All the better to eat you with!&rdquo; cried the wolf, who by now was ravenously hungry. He sprang up and gobbled Little Red Riding Hood in one big bite, just as he had done with Grandma. Satisfied, he lay back down in bed, immediately fell asleep (that&rsquo;s what happens when you eat so much!), and started snoring very loudly.</p>
		<p>Now, Grandma had a good friend who was a hunter. That afternoon, he happened to walk past the cottage and heard the wolf&rsquo;s snoring. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Grandma snoring like that,&rdquo; the hunter said to himself. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right. And the door is open; that&rsquo;s not right, either.&rdquo; He went inside, saw a basket of treats with a bunch of flowers beside it, noticed a broken pair of glasses on the floor, and then saw the wolf in the bed. The hunter understood at once that the wolf had eaten Grandma. And that basket&mdash;I know that basket, thought the hunter. That&rsquo;s Little Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s. Without another thought, he pulled out his hunting knife and cut open the wolf&rsquo;s belly. Out stepped Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood. &ldquo;Oh, whew, it was so stuffy in there,&rdquo; they sighed in relief. &ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; whispered the hunter. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to wake the wolf.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;He went outside, gathered three large stones, stuffed them into the wolf&rsquo;s belly, and sewed it back up. Then all three of them hid in the large wardrobe. Through a crack, they kept an eye on the wolf.</p>
		<p>After a while, the wolf woke up. &ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; he groaned, rubbing his belly, &ldquo;I feel a little queasy.&rdquo; (No wonder, with those big stones in his belly, but he didn&rsquo;t know that!) &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m so thirsty!&rdquo; The wolf dragged himself outside to the stream. He bent down to drink, but because of the heavy stones in his belly, he fell headfirst into the water and drowned.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted Little Red Riding Hood, the hunter, and Grandma, who had seen it all happen.Grandma quickly went back under the covers because she still wasn&rsquo;t feeling well. The hunter and Little Red Riding Hood each grabbed a chair, and the three of them enjoyed the bread rolls, cookies, and wine that Little Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s mother had packed.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmm!&rdquo; said Grandma. &ldquo;Your mother sure knows how to bake delicious cookies, Little Red Riding Hood!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The hunter and Little Red Riding Hood wanted to say something, too, but their mouths were full. And you know you&rsquo;re not supposed to talk with your mouth full&mdash;everyone knows that.</p>

		<p>ONCE upon a time, there was a king who had eleven daughters. Was he happy with them? Yes and no. Yes, because he was rather proud of all those beautiful girls. And no, because they gave him a headache. He was faced with a mystery. For weeks on end, he had to buy new shoes for his eleven daughters every single day. Eleven pairs of shoes each day, that&rsquo;s seventy-seven pairs of shoes in one week. And why? Because the shoes he bought the previous day were already worn out the next: the soles were falling off, the heels were worn down unevenly, the straps were torn, and so on. <br />How could this be? How could those shoes be completely worn out and destroyed in just one night? And it was even stranger because the king locked his daughters in their bedroom every evening precisely at eight o'clock. They couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere! <br /> <br />When he asked them about it, the eleven daughters would lower their eyes and stay silent in every language. The king was completely driven mad by this. And all those shoes also cost him a fortune. At his wit's end, the king placed an advertisement in the newspaper.</p>
		<p>Whoever could solve the mystery of the worn-out shoes would be allowed to marry one of the princesses. You could spend three nights in the girls' bedroom, but if you hadn&rsquo;t solved the mystery by then, your head would be chopped off. <br /> <br />Weeks went by. Many men had tried to solve the mystery, but each one of them fell asleep at some point and could not explain how those shoes became worn out. One soldier, who was no longer young and had been injured in the war, wanted to give it a try. But first, he went to a wise old woman for advice. The woman gave him a cloak that would make him invisible when he put it on. And she also gave him some wise advice: &ldquo;Above all, be careful not to drink anything!&rdquo; The soldier didn&rsquo;t entirely understand, but he decided to follow her advice anyway. <br /> <br />The next day, he knocked on the palace gate. The king let him in and said he hoped that the mystery would finally be solved. When the clock struck eight, the princesses went to bed. The soldier received the key to the bedroom and locked himself in with the princesses. He put the key in his pocket. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the girls were getting ready for the night. The youngest offered <br />the soldier a glass of red wine. &ldquo;You were injured, weren't you?&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;You must <br />need some strengthening. A good glass of wine will do you good!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The soldier was very thirsty and was just about to take a sip when he remembered <br />what the wise woman had said: &ldquo;Above all, be careful not to drink anything!&rdquo; So he secretly poured the <br />glass into a vase. Moments later, the youngest princess showed him to a nice soft bed. The soldier lay down and <br />closed his eyes. The magic cloak was rolled up beside him. <br /> <br />The light went out, and for a long time, nothing happened. The soldier decided to pretend to sleep and began to snore. And sure enough, the light came on again. He heard whispering and rustling all around. &ldquo;That old man would have fallen asleep even without our sleeping potion,&rdquo; joked one of the princesses. The soldier carefully opened one eye and saw that the girls were all taking ball gowns out of their wardrobes. They dressed up, made themselves look beautiful, and pinned pearls, ribbons, and flowers in their hair, and the jingling of bracelets and necklaces filled the air.</p>
		<p>When they were ready, the oldest princess tapped her bed, causing it to sink into the floor. The princesses one by one disappeared into the hole that had appeared. The soldier put on his magic cloak and followed them. They went down a staircase into a dark underground passage. The soldier, now invisible, couldn&rsquo;t see his own hand in front of his face, but he could hear the swishing of gowns and the excited whispering and giggling of the girls. One of them said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I have the feeling we&rsquo;re being followed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; The soldier could barely keep up with the girls. After a while, the passage opened into a magnificent orchard. The trees had silver leaves. In a second orchard, there were trees with golden leaves, and in a third, the trees had diamond leaves! In the bright moonlight, the princesses ran further towards a large lake. Eleven little boats waited there for them, each with a prince inside. The princesses got in. The soldier climbed into the youngest princess&rsquo;s boat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;today it&rsquo;s much harder to row than usual. I think I ate too much.&rdquo; On the other side, they climbed ashore and entered a grand castle. In a magnificent ballroom, music was playing, and they began to dance, the handsome princes and the beautiful princesses. Laughing and making jokes, they glided gracefully across the dance floor, their ball gowns swirling in every direction. <br /> <br />This went on for hours without a single break. As they danced, they refilled their glasses with champagne. Exactly at four o'clock, everything suddenly came to an end. Everyone rushed back to the boats. The princesses ran through the three orchards, dashed through the underground passage, climbed the stairs, and returned to the bedroom. The soldier had run ahead of them, so when the first princess climbed into the room, he was already lying in bed, supposedly snoring.The princesses hung their ball gowns back in the wardrobes. The soldier felt someone take the key out of his pocket. Soft footsteps sounded, the door opened and closed again, and the key was returned to his pocket. <br /> <br />The next morning, all the shoes lay in a pile outside the bedroom door. All of them were broken and worn out. Completely danced to pieces! The soldier now knew the secret. But he said nothing to the king, because he wanted to experience the strange adventure one more time. The second night was the same. The princesses again put on ball gowns, even more beautiful than the previous night, and set out again. In the underground passage, the soldier accidentally stepped on the youngest princess's train. She let out a startled cry and said, &ldquo;I have the feeling we&rsquo;re not alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; the others called, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; <br /> <br />Outside, clouds swept across a dark sky, but in the castle, the chandeliers were lit, and they danced as if their lives depended on it, their faces flushed from the champagne and excitement. The soldier wanted to dance, too, and he took the youngest princess's hand. The girl gave a little scream. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone here!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said the prince she was dancing with, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; When the party ended, the girls all ran back to their bedroom. <br /> <br />And the next morning, the king found yet another pile of worn-out shoes outside the bedroom door! Once again, the soldier said nothing to the king.</p>
		<p>The third night, a strong wind was blowing. In each orchard, the soldier broke off a small branch, and each time, the youngest princess looked around in alarm. &ldquo;Do you hear that? I&rsquo;m telling you, we&rsquo;re being followed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; the others called, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just imagining it.&rdquo; In the ballroom, <br />the soldier picked up a silver cup and slipped it into his pocket. Just before dawn, everyone was in bed again. And the worn-out shoes lay in a pile outside the door. <br /> <br />The next day, when the king asked him if he had solved the mystery, the soldier told him everything. The princesses were brought in, and of course, they said the soldier was lying. But then the soldier produced a silver, a gold, and a diamond branch. And also a silver cup. The princesses burst into tears because they understood that their secret had been discovered. &ldquo;Now you may choose a princess,&rdquo; said the king. The soldier chose the youngest. He thought she was the most beautiful.She wasn&rsquo;t exactly thrilled, because she thought he was far too old. But alas, if you are a princess, you can&rsquo;t just marry whomever you want. No, your father chooses for you. <br /> <br />The princesses never danced again, or at least not night after night. They had been enchanted all along, and when the secret was discovered, the spell was broken. The people of the land were glad. They had to pay less tax from then on, because now that the king didn&rsquo;t need to buy eleven new pairs of shoes every day, there was plenty of money in the royal treasury.</p>

		<p>LONG, LONG AGO, there was once a miller who was very proud of his daughter. He thought she was the most beautiful, sweetest, and cleverest girl in the whole world. He boasted that she could do anything &ndash; whatever you could think of, she could do it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Can she really do everything?&rdquo; someone once asked. &ldquo;Can she also spin gold from straw?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Of course, she can,&rdquo; said the miller without blinking an eye.</p>
		<p>He shouldn&rsquo;t have said that, because a) it wasn&rsquo;t true, and b) that person told the king. And this king was very greedy, especially when it came to gold. So, the girl had to come to the palace immediately.</p>
		<p>The king took her to a little room in the attic. Three bundles of straw lay on the floor, and there was a spinning wheel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if you haven&rsquo;t spun this straw into gold, I&rsquo;ll have your head chopped off.&rdquo; He left the room and locked the door behind him.</p>
		<p>The girl stayed behind in shock. She looked at the bundles of straw and burst into tears because, of course, she couldn&rsquo;t make gold from straw &ndash; who could, anyway?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>As tears streamed down her face, she suddenly heard a tiny voice say, &ldquo;Why are you crying, girl?&rdquo; In front of her stood a very small, dwarfish man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If I haven&rsquo;t spun all this straw into gold by tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be beheaded,&rdquo; sobbed the girl.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;for I can spin gold from straw. But as a reward, I want that necklace around your neck.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said the girl. She quickly took off her necklace and gave it to him.</p>
		<p>The little man put her to sleep, and when she awoke the next morning, she had to squint her eyes shut because the room was gleaming with gold!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The door opened, and the king entered. &ldquo;Well, well, girl,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;you did well!&rdquo; But did you think he was satisfied now? No! He had six more bundles of straw brought in and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow, and if this straw hasn&rsquo;t turned to gold, I&rsquo;ll have your head chopped off.&rdquo; And once again, he locked the door.</p>
		<p>The girl started crying again, and there was the dwarf again. This time, he wanted her bracelet. After he got it, he put her to sleep again and transformed the straw into gold.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But even with six piles of gold, the king wasn&rsquo;t satisfied. Now she was taken to a larger room, stuffed to the ceiling with straw.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Until tomorrow!&rdquo; he said to the girl. &ldquo;You know what happens if you don&rsquo;t spin it into gold. But if you succeed, you may marry the prince tomorrow.&rdquo; And after those words, he locked the door. The girl was desperate. What if the dwarf didn&rsquo;t come? But there he was again.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I have nothing left to give you,&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;You already took my necklace and bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>-----</p>
		<p>The little man thought for a moment. &ldquo;If I understand correctly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you get to marry the prince if I turn the straw into gold. Fine with me, but as a reward, I want your first child.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The girl was so frightened about losing her head that she didn&rsquo;t think twice and quickly said, &ldquo;Yes, yes, I promise!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The dwarf put her to sleep again, and the next day, all the straw was turned to gold.</p>
		<p>-----</p>
		<p>The miller&rsquo;s daughter married the prince, and after a while, a baby was born. The girl, now a princess, was overjoyed. But who should suddenly appear? The dwarf!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for my reward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>The girl began to cry terribly because she loved her child deeply, but that made no impression on the little man. &ldquo;A promise is a promise,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>The girl fell to her knees and offered him all the necklaces and bracelets she had if she could only keep the baby. The little man finally took pity on her and said, &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. If you can guess my name within three days, you can keep your child.&rdquo; And just as suddenly as he had come, he was gone again.</p>
		<p>The princess immediately asked all the footmen, maidservants, and ladies-in-waiting in the palace for their names and wrote them all down. The next day, when the dwarf came to the palace, the princess was ready with a long list of names. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the dwarf. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess started at the top of the list. &ldquo;Is your name Frederick?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the little man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is it Leopold?&rdquo; asked the princess.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
		<p>And so it went on. When she had read all the names, she still hadn&rsquo;t guessed the dwarf&rsquo;s name.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said the dwarf, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow!&rdquo; And off he went.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>Now all the palace servants had to go out and write down every name of everyone they met in the kingdom.</p>
		<p>The next day, the dwarf appeared again and said, &ldquo;Well? What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess now had twenty times as many names as the first time.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is it Alfonso? Is it Arid? Is it Jojo? Is it Samson?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Each time, the little man replied, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And again, the princess hadn&rsquo;t guessed the name.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow is your last chance,&rdquo; warned the dwarf.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>The princess was at her wits&rsquo; end, for where could she possibly find more names? She wandered sadly through the park around the palace. When it grew dark and she was about to head home, she suddenly heard someone singing. Where was that coming from? In the distance, through the trees, she saw a fire burning with something small hopping around it. As she crept closer, she saw it was the dwarf! Silently, she hid behind a thick tree. And this is what the dwarf sang:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad, <br />oh, I&rsquo;m so glad, <br />that nobody knows <br />that my name is Rumpelstiltskin!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You can imagine the princess slept well that night &ndash; for the first time in two days.</p>
		<p>The next day, the little man appeared, grinning.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is your last chance. What&rsquo;s my name?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess pretended to read from a long list of names and began: &ldquo;Are you&hellip; Dabberbeard?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the little man, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;no, that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you perhaps&hellip; Froepeltroep?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No, no, ha-ha, no, no!&rdquo; The little man walked toward the crib.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then maybe&hellip; Rumpelstiltskin?&rdquo; The little man first looked at her in astonishment, then disappointment, and then very angrily. He was so angry that he burst apart!</p>
		<p>That was terrible for the little man, but the princess was thrilled. She took her baby from the crib and danced around the room.</p>
		<p>-----</p>
		<p>That afternoon, the prince, who had noticed none of the drama, came in. &ldquo;We still need to choose a name for our son,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>The girl took out a stack of paper from the drawer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already collected many names. We can choose from these.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The prince kissed her and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I find so special about you, you always think of everything.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And so, the miller&rsquo;s daughter lived happily ever after with her prince and her baby.</p>

		<p>LONG, LONG AGO, there was a woman who had two daughters. One was blonde, the other had black hair, and for reasons unknown to me, she loved the blonde daughter very much and disliked the other. This was despite the fact that the blonde girl was terribly lazy and grumpy, while the dark-haired girl was sweet and kind!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The lazy girl was spoiled; she could lie on the couch all day. The dark-haired daughter, on the other hand, had to work from early morning until late at night. And there was plenty to do: scrubbing the floors, cleaning the windows, and polishing pots, pans, spoons, knives, and forks until they shone like the sun.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, the dark-haired girl was polishing the cutlery again. To her dismay, a little spoon slipped from her hands and fell into the well. The mother became furious. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get that thing back!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how!&rdquo; And she went back to her embroidery.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The poor girl, who was terrified of her mother, tightly shut her eyes and jumped into the deep well. She fell and fell, and she kept falling, and during that fall, she, believe it or not, fell asleep!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she woke up, she was in a park. There were neatly raked flower beds and perfectly straight trees everywhere. Somewhere, she heard a soft voice calling: &ldquo;Get us out, get us out.&rdquo; Curious, the girl looked around. Behind her stood a little oven. Inside were rolls that cried out: &ldquo;Get us out, get us out! We&rsquo;re burning!&rdquo; Quickly, the girl took the rolls out of the oven and neatly placed them on a table.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you, girl, you won&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; said the rolls gratefully.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the girl cheerfully and walked on.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A little later, she came to an apple tree that was sighing heavily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all bent over; I have so many ripe apples hanging on me. I wish someone would pick them.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Quickly, the girl picked all the apples.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you, girl,&rdquo; said the apple tree, which now stood up straight. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the girl and continued on her way.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>She walked under an archway and came to a little house. In front of the house stood an old woman. &ldquo;I am Mother Holle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve twisted my ankle, and now I can&rsquo;t clean my house. Would you come work for me? I will reward you well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Of course, the girl wanted to help her, and she was used to working. But the old woman had a special request. She had to shake the pillows of the beds well because when she did that, it snowed on the people down on earth.</p>
		<p>The girl immediately took the broom and, singing, cleaned the little house from top to bottom. She shook the pillows as if her life depended on it, and feathers flew around.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; said the people on earth, &ldquo;what a snowstorm we&rsquo;re having!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>One day, the old woman said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to go home. I&rsquo;ve seen that you&rsquo;re a nice girl who loves to help everyone, so I will reward you well. Just walk under that archway. And here&rsquo;s your little spoon back.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>As the girl walked under the archway, gold rained down on her. She was completely covered in it.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she got home, her mother gasped in surprise.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How did you get all that gold?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The girl told her about the rolls, the apple tree, and Mother Holle. The mother, who was crazy about gold, quickly went to her favorite daughter and said, &ldquo;You should jump into the well too, then you&rsquo;ll get gold as well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The blonde girl didn&rsquo;t want to do that at all, but her mother pulled her off the couch, threw a spoon into the well, and pushed her daughter in after it. She too fell asleep during the fall, woke up in the park, and heard the rolls begging to be taken out of the oven.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But the girl replied sharply, &ldquo;And my fingers are burning, I have better things to do.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>She walked on and snapped at the apple tree, &ldquo;I have no desire to pick all those apples. You do it yourself.&rdquo; She walked under the archway and came to Mother Holle.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The blonde girl was also asked by Mother Holle if she could help with the housework, especially to shake the pillows well. The girl, of course, didn&rsquo;t want to do that at all, but she thought of the gold and said yes. But even with Mother Holle, she spent the whole day on the couch and did nothing. She didn&rsquo;t sweep the floors or clean the pots. The little house became increasingly dirty, and she only half-heartedly shook the pillows.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What miserable snow this is!&rdquo; said the people on earth.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After three days, the girl had had enough and told Mother Holle that she wanted to go home. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Mother Holle. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your spoon back, and just walk under the archway, and you will receive your reward.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But what fell on her was not gold, no, it was pitch! Thick, black, sticky, gooey, gluey strands of pitch!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she got home, her mother gasped in shock. She no longer recognized her own daughter. And no matter what they did, how they tried, the pitch wouldn&rsquo;t come off!Well, you see, that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re lazy and unkind.</p>

		<p>LONG, LONG AGO, there was a farmer. He was a very good man who harmed no one, but he wasn&rsquo;t very clever. No matter how hard he worked, he remained very poor. His vegetables withered in the garden, his only sheep fell ill and died, and all that he had left was a cow.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, there was no food left in the house. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;but we must sell the cow. Then we can at least buy some food.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next morning, the farmer took the cow to the market. On the way, on a quiet path, a man walked beside him. The farmer immediately felt very uneasy because it seemed as though the man was walking, but when you looked closely, you could see he was hovering a little above the ground.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This must be a wizard,&rdquo; the farmer said to himself, and he walked a bit faster, but the man stayed close to him.</p>
		<p>After a while, the man said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to the market to sell your cow because you have no food left for your wife and children.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer was startled. Now he was sure: this was indeed a wizard!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he asked in a tiny voice.</p>
		<p>In response, the strange man pulled a bottle out of his pocket. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you give me that cow, I will give you this bottle.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A bottle? But a cow is worth much more than a bottle!&rdquo; said the farmer, for he wasn&rsquo;t that stupid.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but this is no ordinary bottle. It&rsquo;s a magic bottle.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You see, thought the farmer, a magic bottle! So it is indeed a wizard!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; the man continued. &ldquo;You sell that cow at the market, you get some money for it, and after a few days, the money will be gone. Then you&rsquo;ll be back where you started. With this bottle, you will have much longer enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But my wife will surely be very angry if I come home with a bottle,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so too,&rdquo; said the strange man. &ldquo;But if she starts nagging, just tell her to sweep the floor, set a tablecloth on the table, and place the bottle in the middle of the table. Then you&rsquo;ll see something. Just believe me. You&rsquo;re a good man, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing this for you.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer suddenly became very scared. Imagine if he was going to cast a spell on me if I didn&rsquo;t do what he wanted, he thought. So he quickly said, &ldquo;Alright, give me the bottle.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And so the man got the cow, and the farmer got the bottle. And yes, of course! At home, the wife began to rage and scream. She called him all sorts of ugly names. What good was an empty bottle?</p>
		<p>The man looked dejectedly at his shoes and softly said that she should sweep the floor, put a tablecloth on the table, and place the bottle in the middle of the table. Just as the man had told him.</p>
		<p>The wife raised her hands to heaven. &ldquo;Man, how can you be so stupid! Sweep the floor, lay a tablecloth, and then what? We still have no food?!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While shouting, she swept the floor, laid a tablecloth, and placed the bottle in the middle of the table.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And what happened then&hellip;</p>
		<p>They couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes. Two little men climbed out of the bottle and set plates full of goodies on the table. And when they were done, they disappeared back into the bottle. The woman called the children, and they all ate their fill. Afterward, they waited in suspense to see if the little men would take the plates away. But that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
		<p>You can imagine that they now put the bottle on the table all the time because they had never eaten so well. They ate the most delicious things five times a day and began to look healthy.</p>
		<p>And they had another advantage: they now had cupboards full of plates. They sold those at the market and made a lot of money from them. The whole family walked around in the finest clothes, and they moved to a large farm with many cows, sheep, and horses.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A rich man, who also lived in the village, visited the farmer and asked how it came to be that he was now so rich. The farmer told him all about the magic bottle.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;May I borrow it for a day?&rdquo; asked the rich man.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, with pleasure,&rdquo; said the farmer, who might not have been smart, but was very kind.</p>
		<p>The rich man took the bottle and quickly returned to his house. He told his wife to sweep the floor and lay a tablecloth, then placed the bottle in the middle. Out came the two little men with plates full of pastries, roasted turkey legs, puddings, and fries. Now this was nothing special for the rich man and his wife. They ate pudding or cake or turkey every day. But this they got for free, without paying for it. So the rich man wanted to have the bottle.</p>
		<p>The next day, he took a regular bottle from the cellar, which looked exactly like the magic bottle. He gave it to the farmer and said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your bottle back. I believe it has lost its magic power because it didn&rsquo;t do anything at all.&rdquo; When the rich man left, the farmer swept the floor, laid a tablecloth, and placed the bottle in the middle of the table. And indeed&hellip; nothing happened.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;we had a lot of fun with it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>In the next part of the story, you&rsquo;ll hear that the farmer really wasn&rsquo;t very clever.</p>
		<p>He had become accustomed to buying everything he wanted, and now that he could no longer do that, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do. So he first sold the fine clothes, then the nice furniture, and finally the large farm. He became poorer and poorer, and after a while, they lived in a little hut and only had one cow left.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer saw only one solution. I&rsquo;ll sell the cow at the market, he thought, and maybe I&rsquo;ll run into that wizard again on the way.</p>
		<p>He took the same path, and&hellip; lo and behold, there he was, exactly in the same place.</p>
		<p>The wizard pulled another bottle out from under his cloak and asked, &ldquo;Your cow for this bottle?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The farmer immediately said yes, and while he was already running home, the wizard called after him, &ldquo;My bottles never lose their magic!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At home, the farmer swept the floor, laid a tablecloth on the table, and placed the bottle in the middle.</p>
		<p>But now, out came not two little men from the bottle, but two big guys with clubs, and they beat the farmer and his wife so badly that it was no longer pretty.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a while, they disappeared back into the bottle.</p>
		<p>The farmer and his wife lay groaning on the floor. The wife felt a bump on her forehead and moaned, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that the wizard said his bottles never lose their magic? Well then, that rich man tricked you!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer took the second bottle to the rich man, who now lived in a beautiful, palace-like house, and knocked on the door. A servant opened it. The farmer asked if he could speak to the rich man. But the rich man had him chased off the property.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it! Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; cried the farmer. &ldquo;Tell your master that I have a bottle for him again.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The rich man heard this and immediately came to the door, patted the farmer warmly on the shoulder, and let him in. His wife swept the floor, laid a tablecloth, and the farmer placed the bottle in the middle of the table. They waited anxiously, and yes! Out came the two big men and beat the rich man and his wife black and blue.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Make them stop!&rdquo; cried the rich man. &ldquo;Ouch, ouch! Make them stop!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Only if I get my magic bottle back,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
		<p>The rich man pointed to a cupboard. &ldquo;There, on the top shelf! Take it away, take it away! Ouch! Ouch!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer could now buy all sorts of things again. But he had become wiser. He no longer bought everything indiscriminately but learned how to grow vegetables and keep sheep and cows healthy. So after a while, he no longer needed the bottle at all and was able to earn his own bread.</p>

			<p>Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter and his wife, and their two children, Hans and Grietje. They were so poor that they were always hungry. One day, the mother had had enough. &ldquo;We have no food left for the children,&rdquo; she said to her husband. &ldquo;I can't bear to see them hungry anymore. Tomorrow, you will take them to the forest and leave them there.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>So, it was decided. The next morning, the father took the children into the woods. He stopped at a clearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to chop wood a bit further away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you will stay here until I come back.&rdquo; He left the last piece of dry bread he had with the children, of course.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The sun set, and Hans and Grietje began to feel cold. Their father still did not show up. &ldquo;He might have forgotten us,&rdquo; said Hans, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s okay, because I know the way home.&rdquo; He took his sister by the hand.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>But under the tall trees, it was very dark, and they got lost. They wandered further away from home all night&mdash; with grumbling stomachs, I can tell you, because one piece of dry bread for an entire day and half a night is not much.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Suddenly, Hans saw a house in the distance. It was a very special house. The walls were made of cookies, and the roof was made of marzipan. Grietje broke off a piece of the roof and was just about to put it in her mouth when a trembling voice came from inside the house:</p>
			<p>**Nibble, nibble, nibble,**<br />**who's nibbling at my house?**</p>
			<p>Startled, Grietje replied, <br />**"It's the wind, it's the wind,** <br />**that finds the house so nice."**</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The door of the house creaked open, and an old woman stumbled out. &ldquo;Are you eating from my house?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Are you so hungry, children?&rdquo; She shook her head sympathetically. &ldquo;But cookies aren't real food! Come inside, and I&rsquo;ll give you a hearty bowl of soup.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>It was warm inside. They finished the soup in no time, and after all that walking, they were so tired that they nearly fell asleep over their bowls. The kind old lady tucked them into bed under a soft, woolen blanket.</p>
			<p>The next day, before dawn, the old woman shook them awake. She was suddenly no longer kind and friendly. And she wasn&rsquo;t stumbling either; it turned out she was very strong. She dragged Hans out of bed and locked him in a cage, throwing the key up on a shelf.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said to Grietje, pushing her against the wall, &ldquo;you will clean this house. You will work until you drop. You didn't think you could eat from my house without consequences, did you?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The old woman was actually a wicked witch; you may have guessed that already. Grietje had to do all the housework. The only thing she didn&rsquo;t have to do was cook because the witch did that herself. And not just any cooking; she prepared the most delicious meals. The strange thing was, she never ate any of it. Grietje only got crusts of bread. No, all the treats were for Hans. That was how it went the first day and all the days after.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>After a few weeks, the witch said one evening to Hans, &ldquo;Stick your finger through the bars!&rdquo; She felt it and mumbled, &ldquo;Not fat enough, not fat enough.&rdquo; Grietje heard that and, while the witch was sleeping, she quietly crept to Hans in his cage.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I believe the witch is fattening you up,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;She wants you to get very fat because she plans to eat you. If she asks you to stick out your finger again, you must stick this through the bars.&rdquo; And she gave him a thin, gnawed chicken bone. Then she quickly crawled back into bed.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>A few days later, the witch said again to Hans, &ldquo;Stick your finger out.&rdquo; Hans stuck the chicken bone through the bars. Luckily, the witch had bad eyesight, so she thought it was Hans&rsquo;s finger. She felt the bone, shook her head, and mumbled again, &ldquo;Not fat enough, not fat enough.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>But after a while, the witch grew impatient. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. I cook the tastiest dishes for him, and he just won&rsquo;t get fat. And I am getting so hungry for little boy meat. You know what? I won't wait any longer; I will eat him today.</p>
			<p>A skinny little boy can also be delicious if you prepare him well.&rdquo; She already lit the oven and looked in her cookbook to see how to roast a little boy. &ldquo;Grietje,&rdquo; she called out, &ldquo;check if the oven is hot enough.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Grietje had long understood what the witch was planning, and she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do that.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You know nothing,&rdquo; grumbled the witch, &ldquo;I will show you.&rdquo; She opened the oven door, stuck her head inside, and snapped, &ldquo;This is how you do it, you silly goose!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Now you can say what you want about Grietje, but she was not a silly goose. She immediately knew what to do. She pushed the witch all the way into the oven and quickly shut the door. The witch screamed for her life, but Grietje didn&rsquo;t pay attention. She pulled a chair to the tall cupboard to grab the key from the cage and quickly freed Hans.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Together, they searched the house, and do you know what they found? Gold coins! Gold coins and gemstones! Drawers and cupboards, everything was full of gold and gemstones. That wicked witch was, in fact, stinking rich!</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Hans and Grietje didn&rsquo;t think long about it. They stuffed as many of those gold coins and gemstones into their pockets as possible and ran into the woods, far away from the cookie-and-marzipan house. They didn&rsquo;t even dare to look back. They kept running, so scared that the witch would come after them. After all, you never know with witches. But eventually, they couldn&rsquo;t run anymore and collapsed, panting, onto the moss. Just when they thought they would never get home again, Hans suddenly saw where they were. &ldquo;Grietje,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think this path leads to our house.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>And he was right! Moments later, they knocked on the door of their house. Their father and mother were very happy to see their children again because they deeply regretted what they had done. They sold the gold and gemstones, and then they had enough money to buy bread, enough for a thousand years!</p>

		<p>A LONG, LONG time ago, in a place far away, there was a miller who had three sons. &ldquo;When I die,&rdquo; he always said, &ldquo;my oldest son shall have the mill, the second my donkey, and the third my cat.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So when the man was dead and buried, the oldest son moved into the mill, the second son received the donkey, and the youngest son got the cat.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, this is something,&rdquo; said the youngest son to himself. &ldquo;My oldest brother can earn money with the mill, my second brother can earn money with the donkey, but how am I supposed to earn money with a cat?&rdquo; He sighed deeply and looked sadly ahead. The cat walked over to him on its soft paws and, to the boy's great astonishment, began to speak! &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the cat, &ldquo;that you can&rsquo;t earn money with me, but believe it or not, I can make you rich.&rdquo; Of course, the boy didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;First, buy me a nice pair of boots,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>What does a cat with four legs need with a pair of boots? thought the boy. But he can talk, so who knows what else he can do? With his last coins, he bought a pair of boots.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The cat stood up on his hind legs, put on the boots, and looked at himself in the mirror. He took a few steps to the left and a few steps to the right, nodded approvingly, put his owner&rsquo;s hat on his head, and walked out the door to carry out his plan. Because he had a plan! A plan to make his master the richest man in the land.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He headed towards the river, where he caught two fat carp. With them, he went to the king&rsquo;s palace. To one of the attendants, he said, &ldquo;Tell the king that these carp are a gift from the Marquis of Carabas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the cat caught two partridges. Again he went to the king&rsquo;s palace. &ldquo;Give these to the king,&rdquo; said the cat to the attendant, &ldquo;and say that it&rsquo;s a gift from the Marquis of Carabas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The king says he wants to speak to you himself,&rdquo; said the attendant, and he brought the cat to the king.</p>
		<p>The king greeted the cat warmly: &ldquo;Well, well, another gift from the Marquis of Carabas. He must be a very nice man. Would you please send him my regards and thank him warmly?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Not long after, the cat heard that the king, along with his daughter, the princess, would take a carriage ride along the lake.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The cat hurried to his master. &ldquo;Get dressed quickly; we&rsquo;re going to the lake.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Once there, they hid behind some bushes. &ldquo;If you want to become rich, do exactly as I say,&rdquo; whispered the cat. The miller&rsquo;s son didn&rsquo;t understand anything, but he nodded obediently. After all, he wanted to be rich!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a while, they heard the sound of hoofbeats: the king&rsquo;s carriage was approaching. &ldquo;Quick, jump into the water, now!&rdquo; whispered the cat, and he ran out onto the road, waving his paws wildly. &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The Marquis of Carabas is drowning, the Marquis of Carabas is drowning! Help, help!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The king ordered the carriage to stop and said, &ldquo;The Marquis of Carabas? Isn&rsquo;t that the nice gentleman who gave me those carp and partridges? We must help him immediately.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The miller&rsquo;s son was pulled from the water and given dry clothes. But that was not all. He was allowed to ride in the coach and sat next to the princess.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The cat did not wait for any of this and had already run ahead. When he reached the sprawling wheat fields, he asked the farmers working there, &ldquo;Whose wheat fields are these?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They belong to the great wizard who lives in the castle beyond the forest,&rdquo; one of the farmers replied, pointing into the distance.</p>
		<p>The cat said, &ldquo;The king will come by soon. If he asks whose wheat fields these are, you must say, &lsquo;They belong to the Marquis of Carabas.&rsquo; If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll bite your head off.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The farmers were a little afraid of a talking cat that walked upright like a person and wore boots, so they promised to do as he said. And off went the cat again.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Soon after, the king&rsquo;s carriage arrived at the wheat fields, and indeed, the king asked the farmers whose beautiful fields they were.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They belong to the Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; they said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the king, looking at the miller&rsquo;s son in surprise. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said again, and the princess smiled kindly at him.</p>
		<p>The miller&rsquo;s son was, of course, as surprised as the king, but he said nothing.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the cat had arrived at the great forest and asked the ranger working there, &ldquo;Whose forest is this?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It belongs to the great wizard who lives in the castle, beyond that hill,&rdquo; replied the ranger.</p>
		<p>The cat said, &ldquo;The king will come by soon. If he asks whose forest this is, you must say, &lsquo;It belongs to the Marquis of Carabas.&rsquo; And if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll bite your head off.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The ranger was a bit afraid of a cat in boots, so he promised to say that. And the cat ran on.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then the king&rsquo;s carriage arrived at the forest. The king leaned out of the window and asked the ranger whose forest it was.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It belongs to the Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; said the ranger.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the king, nodding kindly at the miller&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Well, well, well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The princess smiled and moved a little closer to the boy.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the cat continued running, and now he arrived at the wizard&rsquo;s castle. It was an enormous castle, twice as large and beautiful as the king&rsquo;s. Now, this wizard was a very nasty man. No one dared to go near his castle, for everyone could tell you that he had once turned a hundred people into worms&mdash;just like that, because he was in a bad mood. But the booted cat was not afraid at all; he simply walked right in. Clack, clack went the boots on the shiny marble floor, and the wizard, who was sitting behind a large table, looked up in surprise.</p>
		<p>The cat made a deep bow. &ldquo;Oh, great wizard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone says you are a very powerful sorcerer, but you know, people say so much.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t believe that?&rdquo; said the wizard. &ldquo;Well, just watch!&rdquo; No sooner had he said that than he vanished, and in the wizard&rsquo;s place stood a great roaring lion, which tried to crush the cat with its claws. But the cat had expected something like this and quickly ran away, into the curtains.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo; cried the cat from above. &ldquo;You truly can work magic. But can you also turn yourself into something small? A mouse, for example?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At that very moment, the lion disappeared, and a little mouse scurried across the floor squeaking.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; said the cat, and in one leap, he was down and gobbled up the mouse, fur and all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The royal coach had now arrived at the castle. The king leaned out of the window to see whom he could ask whose beautiful castle this was. To his surprise, the booted cat came outside.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Your royal highness,&rdquo; said the cat with a deep bow, &ldquo;welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the king, looking at the miller&rsquo;s son with admiration.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the princess, extending her hand to the miller&rsquo;s son, who helped her out of the coach. Together they walked into the castle. Everyone was amazed&mdash;especially the miller&rsquo;s son! What splendor and riches: marble and gold everywhere!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Your castle is even more beautiful and larger than mine,&rdquo; said the king to the miller&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I happen to be looking for a man for my daughter,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I think you would be very suitable for that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The princess nodded three, four times in succession, for she thought so too.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Soon a wedding was celebrated, and the bride and groom moved into the magnificent castle.</p>
		<p>And the cat? He got his own room and twenty attendants who did nothing all day but take care of him. He also received a wardrobe full of boots, in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Everything was now rosy and bright, except that the princess could never understand why her husband spoiled that cat so much. Twenty attendants, she thought that was really excessive!</p>
		<p>But, well, he couldn&rsquo;t explain it to her.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who lived with his wife in a very small, dilapidated hut. No matter how hard he worked or how much wood he chopped, it didn&rsquo;t help. They remained just as poor.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>In front of their little house, they had a small vegetable garden, so they always had some vegetables. And sometimes, when the man earned a little extra, his wife would buy a nice piece of fatty bacon.</p>
		<p>One morning, the man got up at dawn and went into the woods to chop wood again. He had some carrots from the vegetable garden in his bag, which would be his lunch. As he was walking home late in the afternoon, he suddenly heard a faint voice halfway, as if it came from very far away. That was strange, because no one ever came to this part of the forest. The man thought for a moment that he might have imagined it, but no, he heard it again, a weak cry: "Help! Help!"</p>
		<p>The man looked around. No one was in sight. He was about to continue walking when he saw something moving under a fallen branch. It was a tiny little man wildly waving his arms. "Help! Help!"</p>
		<p>"I'm coming!" said the woodcutter, quickly removing the branch.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The little man jumped up and dusted off his clothes. "I was looking for mushrooms," he said, "and then the wind blew and this branch hit me on the head. You have saved my life! As a reward, you may make three wishes, and I will grant them all."</p>
		<p>"Three wishes?" asked the man in disbelief. "Can you really grant wishes?"</p>
		<p>"Of course," replied the little man, "but I warn you: think carefully before you wish for something because wishing is harder than you think!"</p>
		<p>"Can I wish for whatever I want?" asked the woodcutter, still skeptical. "Anything at all?"</p>
		<p>"Everything that comes to your mind," said the little man. He waved goodbye to the woodcutter and disappeared among the ferns.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"How can wishing be difficult?" the man thought to himself. "I could think of a hundred wishes in a row: a roasted chicken, a nice fluffy pudding, a delicious warm donut with lots of powdered sugar, pea soup with a pig's trotter&hellip; Mmmm, I&rsquo;m already salivating." He ran home and shouted from afar, "Wife, wife, you won't believe what happened to me!"</p>
		<p>His wife was in the kitchen preparing their meager dinner. "What is it?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"I get to make three wishes," said the man, out of breath, "and they will all come true immediately!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Stumbling over his words, the woodcutter told her everything about the little man. "And now I can wish for anything I want. Anything is allowed."</p>
		<p>"He must be joking," said the wife, as she dished out some potatoes and a boiled onion onto his plate.</p>
		<p>The man, who had dreamed of puddings and donuts all the way home, looked regretfully at the potatoes and the onion. "I wish there was a nice thick sausage to go with it," he said, and scarcely had he spoken when there lay the sausage steaming on his plate, right next to the potatoes and onion!</p>
		<p>"Look, wife, there&rsquo;s a real sausage!" exclaimed the woodcutter in astonishment. "That little man wasn&rsquo;t joking at all!"</p>
		<p>"Fool!" said his wife. "Look what you've done! Instead of nice clothes or a lot of money, you wished for something as silly as a sausage!"</p>
		<p>"I said it without thinking," the man replied, alarmed.</p>
		<p>"I've never seen anything so foolish!" lamented the wife. "Foolish beyond measure! A sausage!"</p>
		<p>"I do like sausages..." the man stuttered.</p>
		<p>"What does that have to do with anything!" shrieked the wife. "A golden axe for you, diamond earrings for me, a beautiful house, or just a lot of money would have been better than a sausage!"</p>
		<p>"We still have two wishes left," said the man, "so..."</p>
		<p>"So-so-so," shouted the wife, "you and your so! You really messed up the first wish! I've never seen such a dimwit!" And she continued to rant.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"Stop shouting!" the man yelled. "What are you so worked up about over a sausage? I wish that silly sausage would hang from your silly nose!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And there hung the sausage from the woman&rsquo;s nose... For a moment, there was dead silence in the room. Then the woman started pulling hard on the sausage, but it wouldn&rsquo;t come off. The man grabbed a knife and tried to cut the sausage off her nose, but that didn&rsquo;t work either. Defeated, they looked at each other. The woman began to cry. There they sat, and now what? The man put his arm around her shoulders.</p>
		<p>"Now I have to go through life with that sausage hanging from my nose," she sobbed. "Everyone will laugh at me!"</p>
		<p>Then the man stood in the middle of the room and shouted loudly and clearly: "I still have a third wish, and I wish for the sausage to fall off your nose!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And it happened. Relieved, they embraced each other, and then they danced around the room. They sat back at the table, neatly divided the sausage in two, and happily finished their plates. Then they went to bed, very satisfied, because no one wants to go through life with a sausage on their nose.</p>
		<p>But yes, they were still just as poor...</p>

		<p>Long, long ago, there lived a king and a queen who had a little daughter. They were very happy about it. The flags were raised, and they threw a grand celebration. They knew thirteen fairies and wanted to invite them all, but the unfortunate thing was that they only had twelve golden plates. Well, they thought, let&rsquo;s just invite twelve of them. The thirteenth fairy surely wouldn&rsquo;t mind. Well, they thought wrong. The thirteenth fairy felt greatly insulted. She was furious, and she wasn&rsquo;t entirely wrong, just think about it!</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>When the feast was in full swing, the fairies took turns coming forward to pronounce their wishes for the child. The first fairy came up and said, "The princess will be very beautiful." The second fairy stepped forward and said, "The princess will be very sweet." The next fairy said, "The princess will be very happy."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>This continued until eleven fairies had wished something beautiful for the princess. Just as the twelfth fairy was about to step forward, she was pushed aside. And do you know by whom? By the angry thirteenth fairy, who had not been invited. She suddenly stood in the banquet hall. No one had seen her come in, and she was furious!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, my wish!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;And I say: when she turns fifteen, the princess will prick herself on a spinning wheel! And she will fall dead next to the spinning wheel!&rdquo; And off she went.</p>
		<p>Everyone stood frozen in shock. Luckily, the twelfth fairy had not yet spoken her wish. &ldquo;I cannot completely undo the wish of the thirteenth fairy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I can make it less severe. The princess will prick herself on a spinning wheel, unfortunately, that cannot be changed. But she will not die; no, she will fall asleep and will remain asleep for one hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One hundred years of sleep! The king and queen were very sad, which you can understand. One hundred years is a long time! But well, it was still better than falling dead.</p>
		<p>The king and queen could think of nothing else. &ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Everyone in the kingdom must burn their spinning wheels. If there are no spinning wheels, the princess cannot prick herself on one.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So they did just that. The very next day, there was not a single spinning wheel to be found in the entire kingdom. The princess grew up, and all the wishes of the twelve fairies came true. She became a beautiful and sweet girl who meant no harm, and everyone truly loved her.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she turned fifteen, her parents remembered what the thirteenth fairy had said. All the spinning wheels had been burned, so the princess was not in danger, but still, the parents were cautious. They decided not to hold a birthday party, for you never know with so many guests. However, the princess did get a day off. She didn&rsquo;t have to attend lessons or do homework that day.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The girl was a bit bored. She wandered through the palace gardens and hallways. She looked into rooms she had never been in&mdash;such was the size of the palace! While strolling, she found herself in the royal attic. There she saw a small door that was slightly ajar. She pushed it open and entered a small room. By the window sat an old woman, and beside her stood something the princess had never seen before.</p>
		<p>Curious, she pointed to it. &ldquo;Dear lady, what is that thing?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The old woman looked up from her work. &ldquo;Dear princess, this is a spinning wheel,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;Come closer, you may touch it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And hardly had the princess touched the spinning wheel when she pricked herself on something. And as the twelfth fairy had foretold, she sank to the ground and fell into a hundred-year sleep.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; laughed the old woman, for&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;she was, of course, the thirteenth fairy who had transformed herself into a sweet old woman!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The strange thing was that not only did the princess fall asleep, but everyone in the palace did too. The cook was just about to give his helper a slap and fell asleep with his hand still in the air. A lady-in-waiting was about to hang a dress in a wardrobe and now slept with the dress in her hands. Even the dogs and the chickens fell asleep.</p>
		<p>The gardener was just trimming a rose bush when he fell asleep. So the bush grew and grew. It grew against the palace walls. It grew all the way over them, and after a few months, nothing of the palace could be seen.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Many years later, only a few old people could still tell that under that enormous rose bush, there was a palace with a sleeping princess inside. The people only half-believed it, but they did give her a name: Princess Sleeping Beauty. There were many princes who tried to chop down the bush to find the princess, but all the branches that were cut off grew back immediately. It was impossible.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When those hundred years finally passed, a prince happened to ride through this region on his white horse. He saw the rose bush, which was now as high as a mountain. &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo; he said to his horse, for that was his best friend. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see if those old stories are true. Is it really true that beneath all those roses lies a beautiful princess sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He got off his horse, drew his sword, and raised his arm to chop. But it wasn&rsquo;t even necessary. The branches parted on their own to let him through. To his astonishment, the prince saw a magnificent palace. He saw the sleeping gardener, the sleeping lady-in-waiting, and he saw beautiful halls, and he couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. When he reached the attic and opened the small door, he saw a spinning wheel, and beside it lay a sleeping girl on the wooden floor.</p>
		<p>This must be the princess, thought the prince. He leaned over her. She really existed, and yes, she was as beautiful as everyone said. Unable to resist, he kissed her, and then&hellip; then Sleeping Beauty slowly opened her eyes.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>You know the rest. Not long after, they married each other. The princess went to bed very late every night and got up again at dawn the next morning. For she had already done enough sleeping.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time&mdash;oh, a very long time ago&mdash;there was a poor tailor who, besides having three sons, only had a goat. He had nothing else. And he was kinder to that goat than to his sons. Just listen.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Every day, one of the three boys had to take the goat to the meadow. When it was the oldest's turn again, he took the animal to a spot where the tastiest grass grew. At the end of the day, he asked, &ldquo;Did you eat enough?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get another blade down my throat,&rdquo; replied the goat. When the son came home, the first thing the father asked was, &ldquo;Did you let the goat eat well?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t get another blade down her throat.&rdquo; I already told you that the father was so fond of his goat, didn&rsquo;t I? Well, he immediately went to the stable and asked the goat, &ldquo;Did you eat enough today?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pfff, enough?&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;My stomach is still growling from hunger.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The father became very angry. &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; he shouted at his son and unceremoniously kicked him out of the house. Can you believe it? He believed his goat more than his son!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the second son had to take the goat to the meadow. He took her to a spot with the tastiest clover. At the end of the day, he asked the goat, &ldquo;Did you eat well?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get another leaf down my throat,&rdquo; said the goat. Once back home, his father asked, &ldquo;And? Did the goat eat well?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;she couldn&rsquo;t get another leaf down her throat.&rdquo; The father went to the stable, and again the goat said she was still hungry. The father became very angry again, grabbed a stick, and chased the second son out the door. The next day, the same thing happened with the third son, and he too was thrown out into the street.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, now the father had to take the goat to the meadow himself. At the end of the day, he asked her if she had eaten enough. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get another bite down my throat,&rdquo; said the goat. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;then we can go home.&rdquo; And at home in the stable, he said contentedly to the goat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you at least ate well today.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pfff, ate well?&rdquo; said the goat. &ldquo;My stomach is still growling from hunger.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You wicked liar,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo; He grabbed her, shaved her head bald, and chased her out the door.</p>
		<p>And there sat the father now&mdash;all alone. He regretted what he had done to his sons and really wanted them to come home, but he didn&rsquo;t know where they were&hellip;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. The oldest son had gone to work for a carpenter. But after a year, he missed his family and wanted to go home very much. The carpenter gave him a little table as a farewell gift&mdash;not just any table, but a magical one. If you said, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; the most delicious dishes appeared on the tabletop, and you could eat your fill.</p>
		<p>The boy thanked the carpenter, put the table on his back, and began the long journey home. On the way, he wanted to see if it really was such a special table. He set it down on the grass and said, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; And yes, hardly had he said it when a platter of roasted chicken legs and a large glass of fresh orange juice appeared on the table.</p>
		<p>When evening fell, he went into an inn. It was filled with people, and soon it became very lively. &ldquo;Shall I show you something?&rdquo; asked the boy after a few glasses of wine.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He placed the table in the middle of the tavern and said, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; Well, you can imagine that everyone fell out of their chairs in astonishment when the most delicious food appeared.</p>
		<p>The innkeeper saw everything happen and thought: I must have that table!</p>
		<p>Around midnight, the oldest son went to his room. He set the table in a corner and fell asleep like a log.</p>
		<p>A little later, the door quietly opened. The innkeeper sneaked in. He had a table with him that looked exactly like the magical table and quietly swapped them out.</p>
		<p>The next day, the boy took the table on his back and set off again. When he got home that evening, the father was so happy to have at least one son back that he invited the whole neighborhood for dinner. &ldquo;And what do you have with you?&rdquo; everyone asked curiously.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; said the oldest son. He had all the neighbors stand in a circle around the table, spread his arms, and said solemnly, &ldquo;Table, set yourself!&rdquo; But of course, nothing happened. Everyone laughed at him. The oldest son scratched his head. He didn&rsquo;t understand at all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The second son had ended up working for a miller. And after a year, he too wanted to go back home. His boss gave him a donkey as a farewell gift&mdash;a very special one, because if you said &ldquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rdquo; five coins would come out of its behind or its mouth.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>He took the donkey by a rope, and as soon as he could no longer see the mill, he stopped and said, &ldquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rdquo; And sure enough, a little later, he walked on contentedly with five coins in his pocket.</p>
		<p>That evening, he ended up in the same inn where his brother had slept. He brought the donkey to the stable, asked for the nicest room, and ordered an extensive meal. &ldquo;How much do I have to pay?&rdquo; the boy asked when he was done eating.</p>
		<p>This boy must be rich, thought the innkeeper, because after all, he wants the nicest room? I&rsquo;ll just ask three coins more than usual. &ldquo;Nine coins,&rdquo; he said without hesitation. The boy only had five coins in his pocket, but that was, of course, no problem. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The innkeeper secretly followed him to the stable and peeked through a crack in the wooden door. When he heard what the boy said to the donkey and saw the coins come out of the donkey, he thought to himself: I want a donkey like that! And while the boy was snoring in his fancy room later that evening, the innkeeper quietly exchanged the magical donkey for an ordinary one.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the boy took the animal by the rope and continued on his way. When he knocked on his father&rsquo;s door that evening, the father was so happy to have his second son back. &ldquo;So, did you bring a donkey?&rdquo; he said. Again, all the neighbors came by, and the second son let them stand in a circle around the donkey. &ldquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rdquo; he called solemnly.</p>
		<p>But again nothing happened, and he too was laughed at by everyone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey, what a coincidence,&rdquo; said the oldest brother, &ldquo;that happened to me too.&rdquo; Soon it became clear that they had slept in the same inn, and they realized that the innkeeper had swapped the magical table and donkey. What a mean trickster! They decided to go to the inn to get the table and donkey back, but they didn&rsquo;t know how to go about it yet.</p>
		<p>And what had happened to the youngest son in the meantime? He had gone to work for a woodcarver, and after a year he also wanted to return to his father. As a farewell gift, he received a burlap sack.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pay attention, this is a special sack,&rdquo; said the woodcarver. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wooden club inside. If you&rsquo;re robbed by a thief, you just call out, &lsquo;Club, out of the sack!&rsquo; and the club will beat the thief until you say, &lsquo;Club, in the sack!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The youngest son said goodbye to his boss and set off for home.</p>
		<p>When it began to get dark, he met his brothers near the inn. They told him what had happened, and the three brothers devised a plan together.</p>
		<p>The oldest and the middle brother looked for a sleeping spot under a tree, not far from the inn. The youngest went into the inn.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want a room that can be locked well,&rdquo; he said to the innkeeper, &ldquo;because I have a sack that is worth its weight in gold.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The innkeeper immediately thought: A sack worth its weight in gold, I must have that&hellip;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And at night, when everyone was asleep and it was dead quiet in the inn, the innkeeper quietly climbed through a window into the youngest son&rsquo;s room. Just as he was about to make off with the sack, the youngest son shouted: &ldquo;Club, out of the sack!&rdquo; The club flew out of the sack and mercilessly beat the innkeeper. The innkeeper screamed, but the boy was not impressed. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t quickly return my brothers&rsquo; table and donkey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you beaten to a pulp.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ow, ow,&rdquo; moaned the innkeeper, &ldquo;yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll give them back, ow, ow!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Club, in the sack!&rdquo; said the boy, and so the brothers got their table and donkey back, and the three of them set off for home.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Of course, that was a party! The whole neighborhood was there again and this time no one laughed at them when the oldest son shouted &lsquo;Table, set yourself!&rsquo; and the second son shouted &lsquo;Donkey, stretch yourself!&rsquo;. On the contrary! Everyone enjoyed the delicious food and it was a real party when they all got a few coins. Then everyone looked at the youngest son, but he quickly said: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring anything!&rsquo; Because of course he didn&rsquo;t want the club to come out of the bag.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Sure! Here&rsquo;s the translation of that passage:</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And the goat? That wicked liar? She was so ashamed of her shorn head that she hid in a fox's den. When the fox came home that evening and saw the two shining eyes of the goat in the dark, he was so startled that he fled into the woods. There he met a bear. Together, they went back to the den. But the bear was also frightened and ran away. The fox and the bear called for the help of a bee, which stung the goat on her bald head. The goat jumped out of the den with a scream and ran like crazy into the woods. No one knows what happened to that goat. Maybe she is still running to this day. Who knows&hellip;</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A LONG, LONG TIME AGO, there was once a man and a woman who were very happy because the woman was expecting a baby! Often, she sat by the attic window and looked down into her neighbor's garden, which was filled with the most beautiful flowers and even had vegetables and herbs growing. She would have loved to walk in that garden to smell all those flowers, but she couldn't because the garden belonged to a mean, wicked witch. Everyone was afraid of her &ndash; people said she could cast spells!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, the woman was again sitting by the attic window knitting a baby jacket. In the witch's little garden, she saw rows of cucumbers, carrots, green beans, and rapunzel, a type of lettuce. Suddenly, she got an awful craving for that rapunzel. She called her husband and said that she would die if she didn&rsquo;t get a plate of rapunzel quickly.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But that rapunzel belongs to that wicked witch!&rdquo; the man said, startled.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; the woman said, starting to cry. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get a plate of rapunzel soon, I will die.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, of course, the man didn&rsquo;t want that. So there was nothing for it: he had to try to get into that garden. The man waited until it was dark and then quietly, without making a sound, climbed over the high wall and tiptoed to the garden. He was just about to grab a handful of rapunzel when the witch suddenly stood before him! That was a shock!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she hissed furiously. &ldquo;What are you doing there with my rapunzel?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My wife is expecting a child,&rdquo; stammered the man, &ldquo;and she has such a craving for rapunzel that she might die if she doesn&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The witch stroked her long chin, squinted her eyes into slits, and said, &ldquo;So, so, a child is coming. Yes, yes. And without that rapunzel, your wife might die.&rdquo; She paused for a moment and then continued: &ldquo;Well, fine. You may have my rapunzel, but when the child is born, it is mine.&rdquo; The man was so scared &ndash; just imagine if she turned him into a spider or something! &ndash; that he did nothing but nod and then hurried away with a sack full of rapunzel.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And sure enough, on the day the child was born, the witch suddenly appeared in the room, snatched the baby from the cradle, and disappeared before the parents could do anything. It was a girl, and the witch named her Rapunzel. She took her to a hut deep in the woods and was never seen again.</p>
		<p>Rapunzel grew up and became a very beautiful girl. The witch, who was almost bald herself, was very proud of Rapunzel's lovely hair. She thought it was a shame to cut it off. Because of that, Rapunzel walked around with braids that were ten times longer than she was.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When Rapunzel turned twelve, the witch locked her in a tall tower, not far from the hut. Why she did that, nobody knows, and it was a special tower, for it had no door. There was only a window, high up, just below the roof. So no one could reach the girl. But how did she get food, you wonder? Well, the witch brought it. Twice a day, she stood with a basket of food at the foot of the tower and called out:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then Rapunzel would wind her long braids around a hook beside the window and let them down, and the witch would climb up the hair to her.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, a prince rode through the forest on his horse. He had been wandering for days when he suddenly heard a girl singing. That was strange, right in the middle of the dense forest! He rode toward the singing, and there he saw a tower through the trees, and Rapunzel stood by the window. What a beautiful girl, the prince thought to himself.</p>
		<p>At that moment, an old woman came walking up. She had a large basket with her, stood at the foot of the tower, and called up:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>Two golden braids fell down, and he saw how the woman climbed up them. After a while, the witch climbed back down the braids and disappeared among the trees. The prince stepped out from behind the bushes. The girl was no longer at the window, so he called out:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And sure enough, there came the braids! The prince climbed up. Rapunzel was, of course, very surprised when a stranger, not the witch, stepped through the window. He was a very handsome prince, so it was no wonder that she immediately fell in love with him. And he fell in love with her too, by the way. They chatted for a bit, and he promised that he would come back the next day. And he did &ndash; not just the next day but every day after that, but only at night because the witch could come during the day.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, when the witch was with her, Rapunzel let it slip. &ldquo;You are much heavier than the prince who comes here every evening,&rdquo; she accidentally said. Oops, it slipped out before she knew it!</p>
		<p>The witch was first speechless, and then she became very angry. Without saying a word, she grabbed a big knife and cut &ndash; snip snap &ndash; off Rapunzel's braids! She tied them to the hook next to the window, forced Rapunzel to climb out, and then climbed down after her. The witch pushed Rapunzel ahead of her deep into the forest. In a lonely dark place, the witch left Rapunzel alone in the woods, without food and without drink.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The witch quickly returned to the tower. She climbed up the braids, brought them inside, and stood fuming in the middle of the room. With her hands on her hips, she hissed: &ldquo;So, prince, come on. Then you'll see what happens!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When evening came, she heard him calling:</p>
		<p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, <br />Throw down your hair in a while!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The witch threw down the braids, and the prince climbed up unsuspectingly. When he wanted to step inside, the witch gave him a hard blow on the head and pushed him out the window. He fell into a bramble bush, landed with his eyes in the thorns, and then he was blind. The story keeps getting sadder...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The prince wandered around in the great forest, and somewhere else in that same forest, Rapunzel wandered as well. They ate berries and drank from forest brooks. This went on for years.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But then things happily turned brighter again, because one day, they happened to come across each other. He heard a girl singing and immediately recognized Rapunzel's voice. Rapunzel cried terribly when she saw that the prince was blind. Her tears fell onto his eyes and... suddenly he could see again.</p>
		<p>Together they went to his castle, where they married and lived happily ever after.</p>
		<p>They certainly deserved that after so much misery!</p>

		<p>**Once upon a time**, there was a soldier who returned from a war. At home, he was told that his father had died. His brothers had divided everything their father owned among themselves. So there was nothing left for the soldier. The oldest brother felt sorry for him and gave him a silver coin as a consolation. One silver coin was all he received. The soldier put the silver coin in his pocket. Since he no longer had a home, he set off into the wide world.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One evening, he came to a large forest. An old, thin man in torn clothes asked him if he had any money, as he was very hungry. The soldier thought: no way! I only have that silver coin, and I want to buy bread with it. But he saw how the old man was trembling from hunger. So he took out the coin and said, "Here, please, I am young and strong; I can go a day without food."</p>
		<p>At that moment, the old man turned into a young prince. Instead of rags, he was now wearing a beautiful outfit, sparkling with pearls and gemstones.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"I am the wizard of this forest," he said, "and because you wanted to give me your coin, I will reward you for your kindness. You may make a wish, and I will fulfill it. Just tell me what you want!"</p>
		<p>The young man thought for a moment and then said, "I have always wanted to know what it is like to be an animal. I wish to be able to turn into a hare, a bird, or a fish." "That is a beautiful wish," said the wizard, "and your wish is already granted." And at that moment, he vanished into thin air.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Can I really turn into a hare? the young man thought. And yes, indeed: there he was, a hare. And just like that, he was a fish for a moment, and a little later, a bird!</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>Satisfied, the young man continued on his way and soon arrived in a village. There, the king was visiting, looking for soldiers to wage war against another country. "Would you like to become a soldier in my army?" he asked the young man. The young man was eager to do so, as he had been a soldier before, and at least he would earn some money.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then came the day when the king summoned all the soldiers. It was time to start the war. The next morning, they departed at dawn.</p>
		<p>Now, you should know that this king had nothing to fear. He possessed a very special ring that ensured he won all his wars. So, when they saw the enemy in the distance after three days, the king was not worried at all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The enemy stood in ten tight rows, ready for battle. Just as the king was about to give the signal to attack, he discovered that he did not have his ring with him. It was at home on his nightstand!</p>
		<p>Retrieving the ring would take three days there and three days back; that would take six days. Four, perhaps, if someone was very fast. That was far too long. What if the enemy attacked? The king was at a loss and desperately cried out, "Whoever can fetch the ring for me and return before evening may marry my daughter!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Our soldier stepped forward and said he would give it a try. He left the camp, hid behind a rock, quickly transformed into a hare, and jumped away. But someone had seen what had happened: an older soldier who was jealous of him because the young man belonged to the royal guard and he did not.</p>
		<p>The young man ran like a hare over hills and through valleys. When he reached a river, he transformed into a fish and shot through the water like an arrow from a bow. At a mountain, he turned into a bird, and shortly after, he flew into the princess's room. There, he transformed back into himself.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The princess was a little startled when she suddenly saw a strange young man in her room, but he quickly explained why he had come, and she understood there was no time to lose. She hurried to her father's nightstand.</p>
		<p>When she handed him the ring, they looked deeply into each other&rsquo;s eyes and immediately fell deeply in love.</p>
		<p>Then the young man did something very clever that would help him later on. "Pay close attention," he said, "and do exactly as I ask." And he transformed into a hare. "Cut a piece from my tail," he said.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then he quickly transformed into a fish. "Pull two scales from my back," he said. And finally, he changed into a bird. "Pluck two feathers from my wing," he said, "and keep all these things safe." And away he flew out the window, back to the king.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>On the way, he transformed back into a fish and finally arrived as a hare at the camp, with the ring clamped between his teeth. The jealous soldier saw the hare coming, grabbed his rifle, and... shot!</p>
		<p>The creature tumbled over. Dead as a doornail. The jealous soldier quickly snatched the ring from its mouth and handed it to the king. He put the ring on his finger, and you guessed it: he won the war.</p>
		<p>Back in the palace, the king went with the jealous soldier to his daughter. "Thanks to this good soldier, we have won the war," he said to her. "So he may marry you. I promised him that. The wedding is the day after tomorrow."</p>
		<p>The princess began to cry. She said that the man was a liar, but the king did not believe her. The princess continued to cry, even on the day of the wedding, and well... a crying bride, that simply could not be, so the celebration was postponed by a day.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the wizard of the forest looked into his crystal ball and saw the hare dead in the field. He rubbed the ball, made a few magical gestures, and said, "Become alive again, hare! Get up and hurry to your princess, for she is marrying someone else tomorrow."</p>
		<p>The hare blinked his eyes, jumped up, and ran to the palace. On the way, he first transformed back into a fish and then into a bird until he ultimately stood before the king as a soldier. "I have come to claim my reward," he said. "I fetched the ring for you, so I may marry your daughter. You said so yourself."</p>
		<p>"That is not true," said the king. "I received the ring from another soldier, not from you." But he was not entirely sure of his case, so he called for his daughter. She immediately threw her arms around the soldier.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"Father," she cried joyfully, "this is the soldier who fetched the ring! Not the other one. The other one is a fraud."</p>
		<p>"Who should I believe now?" said the king, completely confused. The princess ran to her room and came back with a golden box. She took out the tuft of hare's tail. The soldier transformed into a hare. Now the king could see that the tuft of tail fit perfectly into the bald spot on the hare's tail.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then the princess produced the two scales. The soldier transformed into a fish. The king could see for himself that two scales were missing from the back.</p>
		<p>Finally, the king saw with his own eyes that the bird was missing two feathers in its wings. And the princess held those two feathers in her hand...</p>
		<p>The fraud received a hundred lashes and was thrown out of the palace, never to show himself again.</p>
		<p>The soldier married his princess. A few years later, the king died, and the soldier became king.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Sometimes, when he wanted to see how things were going in his kingdom, he flew like a dove over his land, or looked like a fish from the water, or hid like a hare among the bushes. In this way, he learned all sorts of things and could take good care of his people.</p>
		<p>He became the best king the land had ever had.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time &mdash; long, long ago &mdash; there was a fisherman who was so poor that he lived with his wife in an upside-down flower pot. The fisherman didn&rsquo;t mind this; it was just how it was, and in fact, it was quite cozy. Every morning, he walked to the sea at dawn, and he only returned home late in the afternoon with the fish he had caught. He never experienced anything special until one certain day...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>On that day, he caught a fish that could talk. "If you throw me back into the sea, I will reward you," said the fish. "You may make a wish, and I will fulfill it."</p>
		<p>The man was, as mentioned, a content man, so he said, &ldquo;Oh little flounder&rdquo; &mdash; because that&rsquo;s what he had caught: a flounder, which is a type of fish &mdash; &ldquo;little flounder, what should I wish for? I have a wife, I have food to eat every day, and I have a roof over my head. I don&rsquo;t need anything more.&rdquo; After saying this, he threw the flounder back into the sea. The fish disappeared underwater, and the fisherman went home. That evening, when he and his wife were in bed, he told her about the fish.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Could you really make a wish?&rdquo; asked his wife. &ldquo;And what did you wish for?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;We have nothing to wish for.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>That night, the wife thought long and hard, and the next morning she said, &ldquo;Actually, I do have something to wish for.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the man, surprised, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;I would like to live in a real house like everyone else,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;instead of in an upside-down flower pot.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Do you mean that I should ask the flounder for a house?&rdquo; asked the man. <br />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;a small, simple house with walls, windows, a roof, and a chimney. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be big.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The fisherman loved to see his wife happy, so the next day he went to the sea, gathered his courage, and called out:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The sea was calm, there was not a breath of wind, and nothing happened at all&hellip;</p>
		<p><br />---</p>
		<p>The man was about to go home when the flounder poked its head above the water and asked, &ldquo;Well, what does she want?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; said the man hesitantly, &ldquo;she would like to live in a real house&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s already living in a house.&rdquo; And it was gone again, underwater.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned,&rdquo; said the man, and he went straight home. And yes, there stood, instead of the upside-down flower pot, a real little house with straight walls, a roof, a chimney, and windows with cheerful curtains. Everything was neatly painted. His wife came to meet him with open arms. <br />&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful little house?&rdquo; she exclaimed joyfully. &ldquo;And just look how cozy it is inside. This is certainly something else compared to an upside-down flower pot.&rdquo; <br />The man had to admit that. It had been dark as night in the flower pot all day, and now light streamed in through the three windows. There was space for a table and two chairs, and &mdash; what a surprise! &mdash; there was even an extra little room for sleeping.</p>
		<p>The wife was over the moon with happiness. Singing, she kept the little house tidy. But after a few weeks, she said one evening in bed to her husband, &ldquo;This house is quite cozy and nice, but it is also very cramped. We could use a bit more space. If you could ask the flounder for a bigger house tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;But I was only allowed to make one wish,&rdquo; said the man. <br />&ldquo;Oh, one wish more or less,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;what does it matter? After all, he owes his life to you.&rdquo; His wife might have had a point, so when he stood by the sea the next morning, he called out:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The man waited anxiously. The sea was choppy, and yes, thankfully, there was the flounder. <br />&ldquo;Well, what does she want now?&rdquo; it asked. <br />&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;she is very happy with the little house, but it is quite cramped. She would actually really like a bit more space&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;Go home, she is already living in a big house.&rdquo; And he disappeared again into the waves.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And what a big house it was! It had not three but ten large tall windows and a wide terrace. His wife was waiting for him, beaming: &ldquo;Well, what do you think? Quite different from that tiny hut, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo; <br />And that was true. The living room was ten times bigger. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad you asked for it?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Yes, that was a good idea,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but are you satisfied now?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Yes, what do you think!&rdquo; said the wife, proudly showing him five large bedrooms.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But after two weeks, the wife said, &ldquo;This house is beautiful and large, but it all needs to be kept clean, and that&rsquo;s no fun.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;What do you want then?&rdquo; asked the man, startled. <br />&ldquo;A few maids, for example, to help me,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;and also ask the flounder for a cook and someone to do the laundry, and someone for the garden too.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day there was a strong wind, and the waves crashed high against the rocks. The fisherman stood by the sea and called out in the wind:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, what does she want now?&rdquo; asked the flounder, who immediately came up. <br />&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;the house is really very spacious, and we are very happy with that, but it also means a lot of work. She thought that if she had some help&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder, &ldquo;she already has help.&rdquo; <br />His wife was standing at the front door. She clapped her hands twice, and twelve servants came out and stood neatly in a row. <br />&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;they do all the work now.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;did you ever think you would have twelve servants one day? Now you must be satisfied.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t be?&rdquo; said the wife. She folded her hands over her chest and looked content as the servants went to work.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A few days went by quietly, but then the wife started complaining again. &ldquo;I like being in charge of people, but it&rsquo;s a pity there are only twelve of them. I would like to be in charge of many more people.&rdquo; And after thinking for another day, she said, &ldquo;Man, I want to be queen! Then I will be in charge of a lot of people. And I want a palace. Ask the flounder for that tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The man protested vehemently, but the wife said angrily that she would be very unhappy if she didn&rsquo;t become queen. So, what do you do?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next morning, it was very windy. The trees swayed back and forth, and the waves had white caps. The man had to shout to make himself heard:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea, <br />Here is little man Timpetee. <br />My dearest wife Elsebil <br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The flounder appeared again. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;what does she want now?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;She wants to become queen,&rdquo; said the man with his head bowed, &ldquo;and she wants a palace&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She is already queen, and she has a palace.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And indeed&hellip; There stood a large snow-white palace shining in the sun, and inside sat his wife on a throne, in a long dress of red velvet. Around her shoulders was a long red cloak. On her head, she wore a golden crown. Along the walls stood footmen and ladies-in-waiting, all waiting for what the queen would command. The fisherman approached his wife hesitantly. <br />&ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; he said in awe, &ldquo;you look wonderful! Are you really a queen now? Does everyone have to do what you say? Well, now you must be truly satisfied.&rdquo; <br />His wife said nothing; she merely nodded to a footman. He showed him around the palace. It had so many halls and rooms that the man lost count.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a few days, when they were lying in the great royal bed in the evening, the fisherman's wife &mdash; who was now queen &mdash; sat up straight. &ldquo;If the flounder can make me queen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he can also make me empress, and then I&rsquo;ll be in charge of everyone! Man, tomorrow you tell your flounder that I want to be empress.&rdquo;<br />The man wanted to say something, but the wife shook him and shouted, &ldquo;I am queen, and you are just a poor fisherman. So you just do what I say, understood?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>--</p>
		<p>With lead in his shoes, the man walked to the sea the next day. The waves were towering, and the wind was roaring. The man shouted:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea,<br />Here is little man Timpetee.<br />My dearest wife Elsebil<br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a very long time, the flounder came up. &ldquo;Well, what does she want this time?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;She&hellip; she wants to become empress,&rdquo; said the fisherman softly. He just hoped the flounder didn&rsquo;t hear him.<br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She is already empress.&rdquo; And it disappeared into the raging waves.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Now there stood a palace as large as a village! The man had to ask for directions to the throne room, which was now much bigger. All the way at the other end, his wife sat on a high golden throne, her cloak shimmering and sparkling with gemstones. The hall was filled with kings, counts, and dukes, all bowing before her. His wife was now the most powerful in the whole land.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>That evening, from the imperial bed, the woman looked out the window and saw the moon rise. &ldquo;Everyone does what I want,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;even the king does what I want. But that moon, it does what it wants.&rdquo; She shook the fisherman awake. &ldquo;Man, I want the moon to do what I want. Get up, right now! Go to your flounder and tell him I want to be God.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Be God?&rdquo; stammered the man. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible&hellip;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t get any further because his wife had already kicked him out of bed.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Black clouds had covered the moon, a storm was rising, rain lashed against his face, the sea churned as if stirred with a giant spoon. The wind almost blew him over. The fisherman whispered:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Flounder, flounder in the sea,<br />Here is little man Timpetee.<br />My dearest wife Elsebil<br />Wants something that I do not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;What does she want now?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;She&hellip; she&hellip; wants to be God&hellip;&rdquo; whispered the fisherman.<br />&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the flounder. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s back in a flower pot.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Well&hellip;</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there lived a little princess. Now, fairy tales often tell about beautiful and sweet princesses, but the princess in this story was different. She was beautiful (everyone thought she was beautiful), but she was not sweet at all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, she was playing in the palace garden with her golden ball. She kept throwing it high into the air. She loved this because it glimmered and sparkled beautifully in the sun. And every time, she caught it again. Until one time, things went wrong. The ball rolled into the pond and immediately disappeared underwater. It was made of gold, so it was quite heavy.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Out of shock, the princess stood stiff for a few seconds, and then she began to scream and cry at the same time. A frog sat in the middle of the pond on a water lily leaf. It was a large, fat, slimy frog, and it croaked, &ldquo;Princess, why are you crying so?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;My ball has fallen into the pond,&rdquo; sobbed the princess. <br />&ldquo;Oh, but I can help you,&rdquo; said the frog. &ldquo;What will you give me if I fetch the ball for you?&rdquo; <br />---</p>
		<p>The princess immediately stopped crying and quickly wiped the tears from her eyes. <br />&ldquo;Anything, anything: my prettiest dress, my finest earrings, my loveliest shoes, whatever you want.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the frog, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need that. What I want is to be your friend, for you to take me to the palace, to eat from your plate with you, and to sleep beside you in your bed.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The princess shuddered at the thought and almost said, &ldquo;Are you crazy, you slimy beast!&rdquo; But she held back just in time because she really wanted her golden ball back. So she said, &ldquo;Fine. If you fetch my ball, you can come with me to the palace, you can eat from my plate, and you can sleep beside me in bed.&rdquo; Of course, she had no intention of doing that. What did that disgusting creature think?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The frog dove into the water, resurfaced with the ball, and swam to the shore. The princess snatched the ball from its little webbed feet, jumped up, and ran away. &ldquo;Wait for me, wait for me!&rdquo; she heard the frog calling behind her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as fast as you!&rdquo; But the princess ran even faster and collapsed on the couch at home, panting. <br />&ldquo;Phew, what a run! Ugh, what a stupid frog!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>That evening, when the princess, the king, and the queen were at the table, someone knocked on the door. <br />&ldquo;Let me in, dear princess, let me in!&rdquo; they heard calling. The princess was startled because she recognized the croaking voice immediately. <br />The king looked up in surprise. &ldquo;Who could that be? Open the door,&rdquo; he said to the princess. <br />Reluctantly, she stood up. And yes, there on the doorstep stood the slimy, disgusting frog. <br />&ldquo;Go away, you!&rdquo; she hissed and slammed the door shut. &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; asked the king. <br />&ldquo;Oh, just a frog,&rdquo; said the princess, shrugging her shoulders. <br />&ldquo;A frog?&rdquo; asked the king in astonishment. &ldquo;What do you mean, a frog?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;I was playing with my golden ball this morning, and it fell into the pond, and that frog fetched it for me from the water.&rdquo; <br />The king didn&rsquo;t understand anything. &ldquo;And why is he standing here at the door?&rdquo; he asked. <br />&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;I said he could eat from my plate and sleep in my bed.&rdquo; <br />The king looked at her very sternly. &ldquo;What you promise, you must also keep,&rdquo; he said. <br />The princess began to cry and stomped her feet, &ldquo;But I am a princess! And he is just a frog!&rdquo; <br />Now the king became angry. &ldquo;No whining!&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;A promise is a promise, and that certainly applies to a princess. Let the frog in!&rdquo; <br />---</p>
		<p>A moment later, the frog sat at the table next to the princess&rsquo;s plate. &ldquo;Feed me, dear princess, feed me,&rdquo; he croaked. The king still looked sternly at the princess, so what could she do? She gave the frog a bite of her raspberry pudding, and then took a bite herself, and it went back and forth like that. Raspberry pudding was her favorite dessert, but now she could hardly get a bite down her throat.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>After the meal, the princess jumped from her chair and ran up the stairs to her bedroom. <br />&ldquo;Wait, dear princess,&rdquo; croaked the frog, &ldquo;wait for me! I can&rsquo;t walk as fast!&rdquo; But the princess slammed her bedroom door shut with a loud bang. <br />Now the king became truly angry. The princess had to come back down and take the frog with her to her bedroom. And there she lay now, in her soft bed, under the satin sheets, next to her the dirty, slimy, cold frog, who stared at her with his big shiny eyes. &ldquo;Now give me a goodnight kiss, dear princess,&rdquo; he croaked. <br />This is truly the last thing I&rsquo;ll do for him, thought the princess. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll throw him out of the window, and then I&rsquo;ll never see him again. With her eyes tightly shut, the princess gave the frog a kiss. And what happened next, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe! The princess couldn&rsquo;t believe it either. When she opened her eyes again, the frog had turned into a handsome prince!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The handsome prince laughed heartily when he saw the princess&rsquo;s astonished face. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I was not really a frog; I was a prince. An evil witch had transformed me into a frog. I could only become a prince again if I were kissed by a princess. You are a princess, and you just kissed me, so now I am a prince again.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><br />As much as the princess had disliked the frog, she now found this handsome prince incredibly charming. Soon they were very much in love. The prince took her to his own land, and there they married. And they lived happily ever after. Now imagine if the princess hadn&rsquo;t done what she promised; she would never have married this handsome prince. And to be honest: it&rsquo;s a good thing she had such a strict, wise father.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman who loved each other very much and had a lovely daughter. Unfortunately, the woman became ill and, after a while, passed away. It was all very sad because the little girl was now left alone with her father.</p>
		<p>The father was a merchant and often had to travel, and because he didn&rsquo;t want his daughter to be alone at home, he married again after a year. His new wife had two daughters. &ldquo;How nice,&rdquo; thought the father, &ldquo;now my daughter has not only a stepmother but also two stepsisters to play with.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But things turned out differently. There was no time for playing. The woman he married was a nasty one. She spoiled her own daughters terribly. They got everything they wanted and could do whatever they pleased. But the man&rsquo;s daughter had to scrub the floors all day, wash the clothes, fetch water from the well, and also cook three meals a day. Sometimes she was completely covered in dirt and ashes, and then the stepsisters and stepmother would laugh at her. They called her &ldquo;Cinderella.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>While the stepsisters stood in front of the mirror all the time because they had gotten yet another new dress, the man&rsquo;s daughter wore old, torn clothes. She never got anything.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, a few years later, the prince of the land threw a grand ball at his palace. All the young girls in the kingdom were invited. The stepsisters and stepmother, of course, wanted beautiful dresses to wear to the ball, and of course, Cinderella had to make them, in between all her other work. Until deep into the night, when everyone was long asleep, she sat by a candle, cutting and sewing.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The day of the ball arrived. Cinderella was still busy sewing silk ribbons and bows onto the ball gowns. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they done yet?&rdquo; the stepsisters called anxiously. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you work a bit faster?&rdquo; And yet they had spent the whole day in bed!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Finally, finally, everyone was ready for the ball. But when Cinderella also wanted to step into the carriage, the stepmother exclaimed, &ldquo;What? Do you want to go to the ball too?&rdquo; She grabbed a pan full of peas and shook it out into a pile of ashes. &ldquo;First, get all those peas out of the ashes. Then we&rsquo;ll see if you still have time for a party!&rdquo; She stepped into the carriage with her daughters and drove off. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she called through the window, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t even have a ball gown!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>There sat Cinderella, in the ashes, among the peas, in her torn dress. Didn&rsquo;t the prince invite all the girls in the kingdom? she thought sadly.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a fairy appeared before her. &ldquo;Because you are such a lovely girl,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will help you, for I can do magic. Watch!&rdquo; She touched Cinderella with her magic wand, and... you&rsquo;ll never guess what happened next. Her dirty, torn dress transformed into a truly magnificent ball gown made of silver silk, adorned with gold thread and pearls, and on her feet, she wore shiny glass slippers.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Cinderella couldn&rsquo;t believe what was happening! The fairy took her to the garden and magically turned a pumpkin into a carriage with four horses. She took two mice from a mouse trap and&hellip; voil&agrave;! There stood a coachman and a footman. &ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;get in. Enjoy the ball, but remember: the magic lasts only until midnight. After twelve, you&rsquo;ll be back in your torn clothes, the carriage will turn back into a pumpkin, and the coachman and footman will become mice again!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The palace wasn&rsquo;t far away. All the way at the top, on the seventh floor, was the beautifully decorated ballroom. There were about a thousand girls walking around, each one more beautiful and richly dressed than the last, and yet&hellip; when Cinderella entered, everyone looked at her. Who was that beautiful girl in that stunning dress? The prince saw her too, and he danced only with Cinderella all evening.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Cinderella was so happy! She forgot that she would soon have to get the peas out of the ashes, that she had to scrub the floors every day and fetch water from the well. She forgot her stepsisters and stepmother.</p>
		<p>But she also forgot the time! The clock began to strike twelve. Soon, Cinderella would be back in her torn clothes. Fortunately, she thought just in time of what the fairy had said. Twelve o&rsquo;clock! She flew out of the ballroom, down the stairs, and out of the palace gate. In her hurry, she lost one of her glass slippers.</p>
		<p>The prince ran after her, but by the time he reached the bottom, Cinderella was nowhere to be seen. That was a close call! When the clock struck twelve, Cinderella was back in her torn clothes, there lay a pumpkin on the road, and two mice squeaked away. She ran home and hurriedly got all the peas out of the ashes.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>Hours later, her stepsisters and stepmother returned from the ball. They talked about nothing else but that beautiful girl with whom the prince had danced all evening. They hadn&rsquo;t recognized Cinderella at all, that was clear. The prince, meanwhile, was very sad. He desperately wanted to marry Cinderella, but he didn&rsquo;t know where she was or what her name was. He only had her glass slipper. &ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I will travel through the entire kingdom and let all the girls try on the slipper. This way, I&rsquo;m sure to find her.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>So he did. Everywhere he went, the girls had to try on the slipper. For one, it was too big, for another, it was too small, for one, it was too wide, for another, it was too narrow. Finally, he arrived at Cinderella&rsquo;s home.</p>
		<p>The two stepsisters tried with all their might to squeeze their big feet into the tiny slipper, but of course, that didn&rsquo;t work. Disappointed, the prince was about to leave when he saw Cinderella sitting by the kitchen window. &ldquo;I want her to try on the slipper too,&rdquo; he said. <br />&ldquo;That dirty child?&rdquo; cried the two stepsisters and the stepmother in unison. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even go to the ball.&rdquo; But the prince didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>Cinderella had to sit down, and look&hellip; the slipper fit perfectly! Then the prince recognized her and, overjoyed, took her to his palace.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The stepmother and the two stepsisters were left behind with their mouths agape. How was it possible that that beautiful girl from the ball was their ugly, dirty Cinderella? And who would now do all the work in the house? The two sisters certainly didn&rsquo;t want to, and neither did the mother, so it quickly became a terrible mess, I think.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And Cinderella? She lived in a magnificent castle and had a hundred ladies-in-waiting. She didn&rsquo;t have to lift a finger and lived happily ever after with her prince.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy who was so small and skinny that everyone called him Shrimp. His father thought it was time for him to go to work. But everyone he asked for a job said "no." After all, what kind of work could such a scrawny little boy do?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, the boy found&mdash;miraculously&mdash;some work. It was with a judge, an old, nasty, and miserly man. "I&rsquo;ll make him work hard," thought the mean man, "and I won&rsquo;t pay him anything. He can&rsquo;t find work anywhere else. And you know what? I&rsquo;ll fire the maid and the servant and make that shrimp do everything. That will save me a lot of money." Because the boy had to work for two people, he had to get up every day at six o'clock, even on Sundays, and work late into the evening. He did get to eat three times a day&mdash;whatever the judge left on his plate because he didn't like it, that was for him.</p>
		<p>Because of all that work, his clothes quickly became worn out. They hung around his skinny body like rags, and his shoes were full of holes.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Three years passed like this. One day, the judge thought: what will people think of my servant being so skinny and looking so filthy? But of course, he didn&rsquo;t want to buy him new clothes and shoes, so he decided to just fire him.</p>
		<p>But now the boy asked for his wages. <br />"How come wages? I never said anything about wages," the judge grumbled. But then he thought: What will people say if they hear I never paid my servant? So he reluctantly took his fat purse out of a drawer and grumbled as he handed the boy three cents. "One cent for each year you&rsquo;ve worked here, that&rsquo;s more than enough," he growled. "Now get lost."</p>
		<p>And that&rsquo;s all the boy could get. Three cents for three years isn't much, but he had never had money before, so he was quite happy with it.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Joyfully, he set off. At a little grassy area, he sat down on a stone, took the three cents out of his pocket, and counted them over and over. One, two, three. One, two, three.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a skinny old man stood in front of him. "Can I have a cent from you?" he asked in a weak voice. "I haven't eaten anything all day."</p>
		<p>The boy wanted to give the pennies to his father, but he felt so sorry for the old man that he said, "Sure!" and gave him a cent.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The old man snatched the coin from his hand and disappeared without even saying thank you.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy walked on. After a while, he sat down on a log and counted his pennies again. One, two. One, two. And there stood another old man in front of him. He was even skinnier, and his clothes were very worn. "Please," he pleaded softly, "can I have a cent from you? I haven&rsquo;t eaten in five days."</p>
		<p>Not eating for five days? That was really terrible! The boy gave him a cent and said, "Actually, this money is for my father, but he gets to eat every day, so he won&rsquo;t mind if I give you a cent."</p>
		<p>The old man stuffed the cent in his pocket and disappeared without even saying thank you.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Now the boy had only one cent left. That one goes to my father, he said to himself. One isn&rsquo;t much, but one is still better than nothing.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But after half an hour, he met another old man, who was even skinnier and looked much worse than the previous two. He also asked for a cent because he hadn&rsquo;t eaten for a week.</p>
		<p>"Well, alright then," said the boy, "here's my last cent. Because a week without food, that&rsquo;s something I wouldn&rsquo;t wish on anyone." And then something wonderful happened...</p>
		<p>The third man turned into the second man and then into the first man, and then he became a very well-dressed gentleman. "Because you have such a good heart," he said, "you can make three wishes, and I will grant them all. Whatever you ask."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At first, the boy couldn't think of anything, but after some thought, he said, "I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play the violin. I would like a violin that sounds so beautiful that everyone must dance when they hear me play."</p>
		<p>"If that&rsquo;s what you want," said the gentleman, "then I&rsquo;m happy to oblige." He snapped his fingers, and the boy found a violin and a bow in his hands.</p>
		<p>"And what is your second wish?" the man asked.</p>
		<p>"I&rsquo;ve always wanted to shoot well," said the boy, "but all the guns are too big and too heavy for me. I would really like a little rifle with which I can always hit my target."</p>
		<p>"If that&rsquo;s what you want," said the man, "then I&rsquo;m happy to oblige." And there lay a little rifle beside the boy on the ground. "Now your last wish," said the man.</p>
		<p>"I'm so tired of everyone always saying 'no' to me. I would really like people to say 'yes' when I ask them something."</p>
		<p>"This wish will also be fulfilled," said the man. A small pop... and he was gone.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy walked on. He was so happy with the violin and the little rifle that he didn&rsquo;t pay attention, took the wrong road, and got lost. He ended up in a strange town and went looking for a tailor. He asked for a nice set of clothes, and he honestly mentioned that he unfortunately had no money.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And then the third wish came true: the tailor could do nothing but say 'yes.'</p>
		<p>He received a beautiful suit made of shiny silk with lots of bows and ribbons. The boy thanked him heartily and then went to a man who sold carriages. There he asked for a nice carriage with horses, and again he mentioned that he unfortunately had no money. And this man also said 'yes' and gave the boy a beautiful carriage&mdash;one with golden curls. He even got two beautiful white horses with it.</p>
		<p>And there he rode, the boy, in those beautiful clothes and in that beautiful carriage.</p>
		<p>From the other side, another carriage was approaching&mdash;a regular one, without golden curls and with only one horse. And who was in it? The nasty judge!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>"Good morning, sir," greeted the boy, "how are you?" The judge leaned out the window, he didn&rsquo;t recognize the boy in those nice clothes, and said, "Good morning to you too, but why do you call me sir?"</p>
		<p>"Because I worked for you for three years," said the boy.</p>
		<p>"Ah," said the judge, "now I see it!" He looked at the carriage and the nice clothes and said, "Well, well. I can see you&rsquo;ve done well for yourself."</p>
		<p>"Yes," said the boy cheerfully, "just look what you can do with three cents!"</p>
		<p>"And what do I see there, do you have a rifle with you?" asked the judge. "Yes," said the boy, "and I bet you that I can hit everything with it."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The judge immediately hatched a wicked plan. "Everything, you say? You can hit anything I point at? Are you sure about that? Well, good. If you win, you get three hundred coins, and if I win, you will work for me for thirty years, for nothing."</p>
		<p>The boy nodded and picked up the rifle. "Just tell me what to hit."</p>
		<p>The judge pointed to a rock in the distance. "Do you see that dot on that rock over there? That&rsquo;s a flagpole. I know exactly where there is a red stripe in the middle of that pole. I want you to hit the flagpole right in that red stripe." The judge laughed to himself. "Well, you know what? I don&rsquo;t want to be petty. I&rsquo;ll bet double, so six hundred coins." Because he was sure he would win the bet.</p>
		<p>The boy took aim and shot. Because they couldn't see from so far away whether the pole had really been hit right in the red stripe, they rode over there. The fired piece lay in the bushes, and the red stripe had indeed been hit exactly. The judge couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. Growling, he took out his fat purse and angrily threw a hundred coins at the boy.</p>
		<p>"That's all you&rsquo;re getting!" he snapped and rode on.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy walked on and slept that night in an inn. In the middle of the night, three guards woke him up. "The judge says you stole a hundred coins from him!" they said.</p>
		<p>They searched his clothes and found the money. And no matter what the boy said, it didn&rsquo;t help. They dragged him along and threw him in prison. He managed to take his violin with him.</p>
		<p>"I&rsquo;m not a thief," the boy shouted. "I bet fairly with the judge and I won!" But no one believed him, because surely a judge doesn&rsquo;t lie?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy was sentenced to death. He would be hanged in the middle of the square. The square was filled with people. Everyone wanted to see how something like that worked, hanging someone. Before the boy got the rope around his neck, he asked if he could play the violin one last time. That was allowed because after all, no one could say 'no' to him.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy began to play, and immediately the first wish was fulfilled. Everyone started dancing, whether they wanted to or not. The man who was supposed to hang him, to his own amazement, made the most beautiful little dance steps, the guards jumped up and down, perfectly in time. Men, women, and children, everyone danced. The judge too. He was furious. He tried to dance towards the boy, but his legs danced the other way.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>People shouted: "Stop, stop, we can&rsquo;t take it anymore!" but the boy kept playing, and after a while, he climbed down from the scaffold while playing. He walked through the dancing crowd off the village square. When he was far enough away that they could no longer hear his violin, everyone fell down exhausted. The judge too. "Catch him! Grab the thief!" he screamed, but everyone stayed down, and then the judge got so angry that he fell dead.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy returned home to his father without any further exciting events, and he did very well. He lived very happily because no one could say 'no' to him.</p>

		<p>**Once upon a time**, there was a prince who wanted to get married. Not just to anyone, but to a princess, and a real one at that. You might wonder if there are also fake princesses. Well, there certainly are! This prince could tell you all about them. To find a real princess, he set off into the world. Everywhere he met girls who claimed to be princesses, but later he found out that was not true at all!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>After a year of searching without finding a real princess, he returned home to his parents&rsquo; castle, the king and queen. His mother said, "Don&rsquo;t lose hope, my boy; one day you will find your true princess," and she gave him a goodnight kiss. "Now go to sleep."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One very late evening, while the prince was already in bed, there was a knock on the palace door. "Who would be outside in this weather?" the king said, surprised, to the queen, as it was storming like never before. The rain was pouring down in buckets from the sky. Thunder and lightning followed one after the other; it was a dreadful evening.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The king opened the door and let in a soaked, dripping-wet girl. "I am a princess," she said. "I was taking a walk in the woods when the storm suddenly broke out. I lost my ladies-in-waiting and got lost. I wandered around for hours... Then I saw this castle..." She couldn&rsquo;t say more; she was so tired.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The queen had a guest room prepared for the girl, but before she went to bed, she first received dry clothes and a warm meal. "She says she is a princess," the king whispered to the queen. "But is that really true? It seems like everyone is a princess nowadays."</p>
		<p>"Yes," whispered the queen back, "could she really be a true one?" "How can we find out?" the king said softly. "She has good manners and speaks properly, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean anything." Then the queen had an idea.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>On the bed where the girl would sleep, the queen placed a pea. On top of that, she put a mattress, and then another mattress, and another, and another, until there were twenty-seven mattresses stacked on top of each other. On top of that, she placed ten of the softest down blankets. It looked a bit strange, such a high bed, but the queen knew what she was doing.</p>
		<p>When the girl finished eating, she wanted to go to bed immediately because she was dead tired&mdash;and no wonder. She had to climb into bed with a ladder; it was that high.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next morning, the girl appeared a bit pale at breakfast. The king and queen curiously asked if she had slept well. "No, not at all," said the girl. "I had a terrible night. I didn&rsquo;t close my eyes because I was lying on something hard. Heaven knows what it was, but my back is completely bruised."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then the king and queen knew they had found a wife for their son. Because only a real princess would have such a delicate and sensitive skin; only a real princess could feel a pea through that stack of mattresses and blankets. Cleverly thought out, indeed, by that queen!</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>**Once upon a time**, there lived an old king who had a very beautiful daughter. All the kings, princes, and dukes wanted to marry her, but the princess was quite vain and thought herself much too beautiful for any man. Her father, the old king, was rather ill and thought, "I want her to be married before I die. Who will take care of her otherwise?"</p>
		<p>He threw a grand feast. Everyone who wanted to marry her was invited. And they came, from near and far, on horseback or in carriages: the kings, the princes, the counts, in short, everyone of noble birth.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At the feast, all the guests had to stand next to each other, and from that long line, the princess had to choose a man. The king and the princess walked along the long row of powerful and rich men. And what did the princess do? She laughed at them all!</p>
		<p>A skinny king she called asparagus. A rather plump count she called a teapot. One had a head like a potato, another had a neck like a turkey, and a third was as handsome as a wart hog. But she laughed the hardest at the last king because he happened to have a rather long chin.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hahaha,&rdquo; she cackled. &ldquo;His chin looks like the beak of a thrush.&rdquo; Everyone then called him King Thrushbeard.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The princess&rsquo;s father was deeply ashamed. After the feast, he said to his daughter, &ldquo;You have behaved terribly. As punishment, you will marry the first beggar who comes along!&rdquo; The princess shrugged her shoulders. "Sure," she thought.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A few days later, singing could be heard at the front door. It was a poor wanderer trying to earn some money by singing. The king called him in and said, &ldquo;You can sing beautifully! As a reward, you may marry my daughter.&rdquo; The princess fell off her chair when she heard that, but the old king would not change his plan. The very next day they were married, and as soon as the wedding was performed, the king said to his daughter, &ldquo;You are now the wife of a beggar, and beggars do not live in a palace.&rdquo; With those words, he chased them out into the street.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The beggar took his wife by the hand and walked out of the city. After days of walking through wind and weather and sleeping under the open sky, they ended up in another country. When they passed by a large forest, she asked whose forest it was.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The beggar said, &ldquo;The forest belongs to King Thrushbeard. And if you hadn&rsquo;t laughed at him so much, this forest would now have been yours.&rdquo; The princess sighed deeply. Then they passed extensive fields of grain.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Whose grain fields are these?&rdquo; the princess asked.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They belong to King Thrushbeard,&rdquo; replied the beggar. &ldquo;And if you hadn&rsquo;t laughed at him so much, all these fields would now have been yours!&rdquo; The princess thought to herself, &ldquo;I have been so foolish.&rdquo; Then they came to a small, crooked hut.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And whose miserable little house is that?&rdquo; asked the princess.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That belongs to you and me,&rdquo; said the beggar. &ldquo;This is where we will live. And you can get to work right away. Take off your wig and put on this old dress because the wife of a beggar doesn&rsquo;t wear a wig and doesn&rsquo;t wander around in ball gowns. And then prepare something to eat because I am dead tired and hungry.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But the beggar had bad luck because the princess couldn&rsquo;t cook at all. The man shook his head in disbelief and then went to prepare the food himself.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t earn enough with singing for both of us,&rdquo; said the beggar the next day. &ldquo;You need to bring in some money too.&rdquo; He went outside and cut some branches from a willow tree. &ldquo;Make some baskets from these; you can sell them at the market.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But the princess was so clumsy that she cut her fingers. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything!&rdquo; grumbled the beggar. &ldquo;Then go weave; we can sell the fabric at the market.&rdquo; But she didn&rsquo;t succeed there either.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What good are you to me?!&rdquo; the beggar exclaimed in irritation. &ldquo;What can you actually do?!&rdquo; The princess looked at the ground and was deeply ashamed. &ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; said the beggar then, &ldquo;I will look for some pots that you can sell at the market.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>So, it was said, so it was done. The next morning, the beggar loaded a pile of pots onto a cart at dawn and had the princess push it to the market. In a sunny spot, she displayed her wares, and soon it turned out that the princess was a good market vendor.</p>
		<p>Business went well. People liked to buy from her because she was so beautiful, and every day she came home with enough money to buy bread. The beggar was satisfied. &ldquo;With my singing and your pots, at least we have something to eat every day,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>His wife looked at him gratefully. For the first time, her husband was not angry with her.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>One day, she was again at the market when suddenly a drunken rider came galloping in, trampling through her pots. Everything lay in shards!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When she came home, the beggar was furious. &ldquo;Who is so stupid to sit in that spot?&rdquo; he raged. &ldquo;You know that many riders come by there! What good is such a foolish goose as you to me?!&rdquo; The princess cried bitter tears.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, the next day her husband was in a better mood. &ldquo;We are in luck,&rdquo; he said when he came home from singing. &ldquo;I heard that the king&rsquo;s cook needs a kitchen helper. You can start tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>And so the princess went to work in the palace kitchen. She sewed seven little pots into her apron and filled them each day with the leftovers from the royal meals. When she came home in the evening, she set the table, and she and her husband ate the leftovers.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, the king held a feast. The princess hid behind a curtain and peeked at all the distinguished and beautifully dressed guests. Tears filled her eyes. How sorry she felt! Because she had been so mean to all those kings and princes who wanted to marry her, she was now a kitchen helper!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Suddenly, the curtain she was hiding behind was pulled aside. A handsome young man pulled her into the ballroom. In the rush, the pots fell out of her apron, and the food scraps flew across the dance floor. Everyone saw it and began to laugh. What was that dirty person doing there with all that food?</p>
		<p>The princess wanted to sink into the ground from shame. She wanted to run away, but the young man stopped her. Suddenly she recognized him: it was her own husband!</p>
		<p>She couldn&rsquo;t understand it. How did he come by those beautiful clothes? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; said her husband, taking her in his arms. &ldquo;I am the king. I pretended to be a poor beggar living in a hut. I was also that drunken rider at the market. And do you know why? To teach you a lesson because you made a fool of me and everyone else at that feast.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then King Thrushbeard&mdash;because that was who he was&mdash;said this, and he had a beautiful ball gown brought for her. &ldquo;Put this on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then we will dance.&rdquo; And they did, until deep into the night.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Now she was no longer married to a beggar but to a king! They lived happily ever after in his beautiful palace. She was still as beautiful as before, but much, much kinder, and she was no longer vain at all. Her husband&rsquo;s chin was still quite large, but she never laughed at it again because she now knew all too well what it felt like to be laughed at.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Once upon a time, there was a king who had a beautiful daughter. He adored her, so when she was old enough to marry, he was not pleased at all. He didn't want her to get married because then she would live somewhere else, and he found that very lonely. But a princess must marry; that's just how it is...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then the king came up with a clever idea. He had a tall glass mountain built, and at the very top, he placed a throne. The princess had to sit on it with three oranges on her lap. Then he let everyone in the whole kingdom know that whoever could grab the oranges could marry the princess.</p>
		<p>Well, everyone wanted to try, because she was a very beautiful girl. Of course, the king secretly hoped that no one would succeed.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>In that same land lived a farmer with three sons. The two older boys were tall and strong; he was proud of them. But the youngest was quite small and frail. The farmer didn't think much of him, so he made him do all the dirty work. The boy had to clean the cow and pig stables every day, and as a result, he always smelled like dung and urine.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The farmer was quite wealthy because, besides all those animals, he also had twelve extensive meadows filled with lush grass for his cows to graze on.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One morning, the farmer woke up and saw through the window that all the grass in one meadow had been cut. The farmer couldn't understand it. Who had done that? The meadow was completely bare&mdash;there wasn't a single blade of grass left.</p>
		<p>The next day, another meadow had been cut, and then the farmer began to worry. "You should keep watch over the meadows tonight," he said to his eldest son. "I want to know who is mowing them."</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>When it got dark, the eldest son sat under a tree. But around midnight, he fell asleep. The next morning, when he woke up, another meadow had been cut, but of course, the boy couldn't say who had done it.</p>
		<p>That evening, the father let the second son keep watch. But he too fell asleep, and again another meadow had been cut, and the second son couldn't say who the mower was.</p>
		<p>Then the third son said he wanted to try.</p>
		<p>The father and his two brothers laughed at him. "You? If we couldn't do it, how could you?" And they threw rotten eggs in his face!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But the youngest son did it anyway. As it got dark, he sat under the tree and pinched himself every few minutes to stay awake.</p>
		<p>At exactly midnight, the earth suddenly began to shake violently. The tree swayed back and forth, and there was a deafening sound of hooves that quickly approached. The boy quickly climbed the tree and saw a pure white horse galloping towards him. It began to graze by the meadow.</p>
		<p>The boy couldn't take his eyes off the horse, and when it walked beneath the tree, he jumped onto its back. The horse reared up for a moment, so the boy grabbed its mane tightly. Then it galloped away into the forest with the boy on its back.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next morning, the boy came home on foot and said, "You can sleep peacefully from now on. The meadows won't be mowed anymore; I've taken care of it." His father and brothers laughed at him again. "Yeah right, we believe that right away!" And they threw rotten pears at him. But the boy was right: the meadows were no longer mowed.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>Then they heard about the princess on the glass mountain. The eldest son immediately said, "Father, I'm going to try to grab those three oranges because I would like to marry a princess."</p>
		<p>"Son," said the father, "that won't be easy because how will you climb such a slippery mountain?"</p>
		<p>"Oh," said the eldest, "I'll figure something out." "I'll help you," said the second son.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The youngest wanted to go too, but the other two said meanly, "We don't want a stinky brat like you with us!" And they threw rotten tomatoes at his head.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The two brothers set off immediately. They could see the palace from afar. The glass mountain in the garden shimmered in the sun, and on top of it sat the breathtakingly beautiful princess with the three oranges on her lap.</p>
		<p>Many princes, dukes, and even common men had tried to climb the mountain, but no one had succeeded, and the king was laughing to himself.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>Now it was the turn of the two brothers. After one step on the glass mountain, they slid right back down. The king laughed at them and sent them home immediately. But just before they turned around, something very special happened...</p>
		<p>A prince rode up on a white horse, dressed in shining steel armor. He stormed up the glass mountain. The princess couldn't even see his face; it all happened so quickly, but she could smell him!</p>
		<p>"I don't want to marry such a stinker," she said. She pinched her nose shut and threw an orange at the horse's head. The horse got startled, and horse, prince, and orange all slid down&mdash;whoosh!</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>When they got home, the brothers excitedly told about the prince on the horse. "You should have seen him!" they cried. "That prince looked splendid!"</p>
		<p>"What a shame I wasn't there," sighed the youngest brother. And the two eldest threw rotten green beans at his head.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the two brothers tried again. This time they brought an axe and tried to chop steps into the glass. But the glass was way too hard!</p>
		<p>The king laughed at them and sent them home again. And there came that same prince on his white horse again. This time, he wore silver armor. He stormed up the mountain again and got a little closer to the princess. Again, she wrinkled her nose when she smelled him, but when she saw his face... she immediately fell head over heels in love. Quickly, she threw an orange at him. He barely caught it before sliding down with horse and all.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At home, the two brothers were again full of praise for the unknown prince: "You should have seen him!" they told their youngest brother&mdash;just to tease him and make him jealous.</p>
		<p>"I wish I had been there," sighed the youngest again. His brothers threw rotten apples at his head.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, the brothers went back to the mountain&mdash;this time with nails under their shoes. But the nails didn't help at all, and after just three steps, they slid down again. And here came the prince on his horse again. Now he was completely covered in gold. He stormed up the mountain again and could almost touch the princess's legs, almost... But before he slid down again, the princess quickly put the third orange into his hand. In the blink of an eye, the prince had disappeared into the forest.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>What a commotion! That prince now had all three oranges and could marry the princess, but where was he? And who was he? No one knew...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The lovesick princess now wanted to find her prince at all costs, and although the king still didn't like the idea of her getting married, he decided to help her. After all, he adored her.</p>
		<p>He announced that all the men in the kingdom should come to the palace. The two eldest brothers set off too. Of course, the youngest was not allowed to go again, but he secretly went anyway...</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At the palace, it was crowded with men. The princess looked at them all one by one, but her prince was not among them. When she had almost gone through everyone, she suddenly smelled a familiar odor: dung and urine. The princess turned around with her nose in the air, followed the smell sniffing, and found the youngest brother hiding behind a tree. She didn't even recognize him in his dirty, torn cloak!</p>
		<p>Then the boy took the three oranges out of his pockets and removed the cloak, and everyone exclaimed, "Ooh!"</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>For what lay underneath? A golden armor!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At a fountain in the courtyard of the castle, he washed his face. And now she recognized him. The boy and the princess embraced each other, they married, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The white horse, which was of course a magical horse, could now graze wherever it wanted. And the father and the two brothers? They regretted treating the boy so cruelly. But that had actually been his luck, because if he hadn't smelled so bad&mdash;of dung, urine, and rotten things&mdash;the princess would never have found him among all those men. All's well that ends well! But not for the king. He found it quite boring to be all alone in that big palace.</p>

		<p>Just imagine if there were rats running all over the room&mdash;big, fat black rats on the chairs, on the tables, in the cupboards, rats crawling over your stomach and legs, rats gnawing at your ears&hellip; They were everywhere, wherever you looked&mdash;in your bed, in the kitchen, on the street, on the roofs! When you were eating, rats would snatch your bread away. In the toilet, rats would bite your behind&hellip;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Well, this happened a long time ago in a little town called Hamelin. The people were desperate. Even if they killed three hundred rats a day, the next day there would be four hundred more. They sealed up all the holes and cracks in their houses. They didn&rsquo;t dare go outside anymore because outside was filled with squeaking, grinding, gnawing, and the scratching of rat feet on the cobblestones.</p>
		<p>And then, suddenly, on a chilly day, while dark clouds raced across the sky, a strange man stood in the middle of the square, surrounded by all those rats. His wide black cloak fluttered in the wind. Who he was and where he came from, no one knew. The people peeked at him through their curtains. He walked to the mayor&rsquo;s house.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can rid you of the rats in one day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I am a rat catcher.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Really, in one day?&rdquo; asked the mayor. &ldquo;Are you sure? All those thousands of rats?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Of course, just trust me. No one can do it except me,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The mayor fell to his knees and said, &ldquo;If you can free us from this plague, we will be eternally grateful. Ask for whatever you want, and you shall have it, for this is no way to live.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;In Hamelin, there are five hundred families,&rdquo; said the rat catcher, &ldquo;and I ask for two gold coins from each family; that will total one thousand gold coins.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And if we find even one rat in Hamelin afterward,&rdquo; asked the mayor, &ldquo;what then?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t have to pay me anything,&rdquo; said the rat catcher.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>The mayor immediately summoned all the inhabitants of Hamelin to the church and told them about the rat catcher. Everyone started talking at once. Everyone was willing to pay those two gold coins, even ten or twenty if that man could just rid them of that terrible rat plague. When the stranger heard this, he nodded. &ldquo;I will start tonight when the moon rises. No one may go outside; everyone must stay indoors. And keep the reward ready, for I will come to collect it soon.&rdquo; And off he went.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Evening fell, and when the moon rose, the people peeked out from behind their curtains to see the rat catcher standing in the square among all the rats. He pulled out a long silver flute and began to play. It was a very thin and shrill tune, so strange that the people held their breath.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>They had never heard anything like it before. And then, from everywhere, from holes and crevices and burrows, the rats came out. The square became fuller and fuller with rats. When no more rats came, the man, still playing his flute, walked down the main street and out of the village. The rats followed him in long lines, through forests and across fields. At a wide river flowing to the sea, he stopped. The rats seemed enchanted. They all jumped into the water, hundreds at a time, and swam to the sea.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The people in the village danced and sang in the streets. They could hardly believe it. There were truly no rats in sight anymore! They could laugh again and do their shopping, eat, and sleep. And after a week, they had even almost forgotten about the rats.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The mayor came by and asked for two gold coins from each family for the rat catcher. A thousand gold coins, the people grumbled; wasn&rsquo;t that a bit much? And for what, really? Maybe the rats would have disappeared on their own one day. Maybe that man wasn&rsquo;t needed at all. Ten gold coins instead of a thousand would be more than enough, everyone thought. And the mayor thought so too.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>A few days later, the rat catcher came to collect his thousand gold coins. &ldquo;We think ten gold coins are more than enough,&rdquo; said the mayor, &ldquo;for who says the rats won&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The rat catcher became very angry and threw the gold coins on the floor. &ldquo;You can keep your ten gold coins. But you will regret this.&rdquo; And away he went.</p>
		<p>Well, the people were absolutely delighted. They were rid of the plague, and it cost them not a penny!</p>
		<p>The next evening, they all went to church to talk about that rat catcher. He was actually a fraud, they said. A thousand gold coins! Did that man really think they were that stupid?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Only when the sun was almost up did everyone go home. But there, a shock awaited them! All the children of the town had disappeared! The people couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. Where on earth had they gone?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Then a little boy crawled out from under a bed in one of the houses. He said that the rat catcher had come back and had played his flute in the square. All the children had come out of their beds and followed him out of town. That was all he knew.</p>
		<p>Everyone grabbed a stick or a club and ran in the direction the boy pointed out. They could easily follow the many footprints of the children. They went into the mountains. But suddenly, the trail ended right before a steep rock wall. It was as if they had disappeared into the rocks. It was a mystery! How could all those children simply vanish into a rock?</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The mystery has never been solved. The children were never found. No one has ever heard or seen anything of them again. Of course, what the rat catcher did, luring all the children out of the town, wasn&rsquo;t right. But on the other hand, if you make a promise, you should keep it. Right?</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Once upon a time, there was a war somewhere again. One country wanted to take another country and sent armies against it. The soldiers set fire to everything they came across, and then they stormed the king&rsquo;s palace. The king and queen were killed, but their children&mdash;the prince and the princess&mdash;could not be found. They had escaped through a secret door and fled straight into the woods.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The prince and princess did not dare to rest for a moment and kept running further and further away from the palace and the soldiers, getting deeper into the forest. The little prince became very thirsty, which was no surprise after all that running.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, they saw a little lake glimmering between the trees a bit further away. The boy ran toward it. But his sister did not trust it. She saw that there were horses standing on the shore, all looking rather sad.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t drink!&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;That lake might be enchanted. Those horses must be people who drank from the water.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They walked on and soon came to another little lake.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The boy bent over to drink, but there were dogs lined up along the shore, all looking very sad in their eyes. Once again, the princess called out that he shouldn&rsquo;t drink, as those dogs were surely people who had drunk from the water. So they walked on. The prince said he would die if he didn&rsquo;t get something to drink soon. Then they saw yet another lake. This time, there were cats lining the shore. The princess cried out again that he mustn&rsquo;t drink, but it was too late. Her little brother had already taken a sip and, before her eyes, transformed into a kitten!</p>
		<p>The princess let out a scream of horror. But there was no time to grieve, as the gunshots from the soldiers sounded far too close. She picked up the kitten and ran on, for days on end.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Thus, they found themselves in a strange land. At the king's palace, the kitten wriggled free, and before the princess could do anything, it had disappeared into the palace garden.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; the princess cried in alarm, and she ran after the kitten.</p>
		<p>The king happened to be at the window and had seen everything. He found her so beautiful that he called her inside and asked if she would marry him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would like that,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;but only if I can always keep my kitten with me.&rdquo; The king naturally agreed. So two days later, they got married.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Now, not far from the palace lived a witch who was in love with the king. But the king wanted nothing to do with her, for who falls in love with a witch? She became incredibly jealous when she heard about the wedding.</p>
		<p>One day, the princess (who was now a queen) was walking in the palace garden with her kitten.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, the witch appeared before her and said, &ldquo;You may be married to the king, but he would have much preferred to marry me. So it would be better for you to leave.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Of course, the girl did not want that.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then I will make you sick,&rdquo; screamed the witch, &ldquo;so sick that you will hang in a chair all day, utterly exhausted and disinterested in anything.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And that happened. The king was not at all pleased that his wife sat in a chair all day, staring into space, even losing the will to eat or drink.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, out of nowhere, the witch appeared again before the queen. &ldquo;I have taken pity on you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will make you well again. Go to the lake behind the palace. Undress there and take a bath.&rdquo; And away she went. With great effort, the queen dragged herself to the lake. She undressed and was just about to step into the water when the witch jumped out from behind a tree. She had a thick rope with her, to which a stone was tied. In a flash, she bound the rope around the queen&rsquo;s waist. With a cackling laugh, she threw the stone into the water.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The queen was dragged down by the rope. With a splash, she disappeared into the lake and sank immediately to the bottom. She tried to loosen the rope, but the knot was tied so tightly that it wouldn&rsquo;t budge. The kitten had fled in fright behind a tree, but the princess did not come up.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The witch rubbed her hands together, laughed her cackling laugh again, put on the queen&rsquo;s clothes, and magically transformed her ugly face into the pretty face of the queen. And so, she walked to the king.</p>
		<p>He was, of course, very happy to see his wife so cheerful again. &ldquo;Where is your kitten?&rdquo; he asked, for his wife always had the little creature with her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh, that childish nonsense,&rdquo; said the witch. &ldquo;I have no idea where that animal is.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The king thought this was strange, but he didn&rsquo;t dwell on it for long.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, when the witch was alone with the kitten, she said to the creature, &ldquo;When I see you, I think of your sister, and I have no desire for that at all.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The kitten was frightened out of its wits and ran into the garden toward the little lake. &ldquo;Sister, sister,&rdquo; meowed the kitten, &ldquo;I think the witch wants to kill me. Help me!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; called the girl from the bottom of the lake, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything. I&rsquo;m tied to that stone.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>By coincidence, the king was walking nearby and heard this. He recognized his wife&rsquo;s voice and immediately understood the situation. Without a second thought, he jumped into the water and cut the rope with a knife.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Together, the three of them walked back to the palace. The witch was terrified, as you can imagine, when she saw the king, the queen, and the kitten together.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Actually, I should throw you into the lake,&rdquo; said the king to the witch, &ldquo;with a stone around your neck. But if you turn the kitten back into a prince, I will let you live.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The witch began to curse and rage. She now looked as she really was: a mean face with a hooked nose and a jutting chin.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Watch out,&rdquo; said the king, taking a step toward her, &ldquo;or I will throw you into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Now witches hate water, so she had to do what the king wanted. She had no choice. She muttered a few spells, and the kitten turned back into a prince.</p>
		<p>Then the witch had to turn all the horses, dogs, and cats back into their original forms because, yes, she was the one who had enchanted all those people by the lakes.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>She was allowed to live, but she was imprisoned. And she had to take a bath every day, which caused her to lose her magical powers after some time. From time to time, she was allowed to go outside, but only under strict supervision.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The king finally heard the whole story about the war. He sent a large army to his wife&rsquo;s country and drove away the enemy. Now the king had two countries. But he didn&rsquo;t mind that at all. On the contrary.</p>

		<p>ONCE UPON A TIME**, there was a woman who had three daughters. The oldest had only one eye instead of two, the second had two eyes, and the youngest had three. That&rsquo;s why the girls were named One-Eye, Two-Eyes, and Three-Eyes. The mother was proud of One-Eye and Three-Eyes &ndash; at least they were special. She found Two-Eyes rather ordinary, so she made her do all the work in the house and in the garden, and take the goat to the pasture every day. She also had to prepare three meals a day. The mother, One-Eye, and Three-Eyes would eat until they were full, and they would throw the leftovers into a corner for Two-Eyes. Two-Eyes&rsquo; stomach grumbled from hunger while she took the goat to the pasture.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One day, in the pasture, Two-Eyes could no longer bear it and started to cry terribly. Suddenly, an old woman appeared before her. &ldquo;Why are you crying, girl?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry,&rdquo; said Two-Eyes. &ldquo;My mother and my two sisters eat until they are full every day, and I only get the leftovers.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry anymore,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;Because you are such a sweet girl, I will help you. From now on, when you are hungry again, just go to your little goat and say, &lsquo;Goat, bleat! Table, set!&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll see something wonderful!&rdquo; And suddenly she was gone.</p>
		<p>Well, such a thing doesn&rsquo;t happen every day, so Two-Eyes immediately went to the goat and said, &ldquo;Goat, bleat! Table, set!&rdquo; And hardly had she said it when there stood a neatly set table, and she could feast on veal croquettes, cabbage rolls, a golden pudding, and a big glass of cold cherry lemonade.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At home, she had to start cooking right away because her mother and sisters were already shouting, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s our food!&rdquo; After the meal, they plopped down on the couch, burping, to see how Two-Eyes would eat the leftovers. But today, Two-Eyes had no appetite at all after all those veal croquettes, cabbage rolls, that golden pudding, and the big glass of lemonade. They saw that Two-Eyes swept the leftovers together and threw them in the trash.</p>
		<p>The mother and the two sisters looked at each other, dumbfounded. Something was not right! The mother leaned toward One-Eye and said, &ldquo;You should go with Two-Eyes to the pasture tomorrow. I think something happened there that&rsquo;s making Two-Eyes not want those leftovers, so pay attention.&rdquo; The next day, One-Eye went to the pasture with Two-Eyes. Two-Eyes understood why.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Now, One-Eye was not used to walking so much, so when they arrived at the pasture, she was quite tired. &ldquo;You can rest on this soft grass,&rdquo; said Two-Eyes to One-Eye, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing a song for you.&rdquo; A little later, One-Eye lay peacefully asleep. Just to be sure, Two-Eyes said:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;One-Eye, are you awake? <br />One-Eye, are you sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One-Eye didn&rsquo;t say anything; she was sleeping like a rose.</p>
		<p>Two-Eyes walked to her goat and said, &ldquo;Goat, bleat! Table, set!&rdquo; The table appeared again, now with delicious apple fritters, custard, and apple lemonade. When she had finished everything, she woke One-Eye, and together they walked back home.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>At home, Two-Eyes immediately got to work with the pots and pans. The mother took One-Eye by the arm and asked, &ldquo;What happened in the pasture? Did you see anything special?&rdquo; One-Eye said that she had fallen asleep and thus saw nothing.</p>
		<p>Then the mother said to Three-Eyes: &ldquo;You should go to the pasture tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t fall asleep, and use your three eyes well!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, Three-Eyes went to the pasture. Three-Eyes also wasn&rsquo;t used to walking that far, so Two-Eyes told her to lie comfortably in the grass, and she would sing a song for her. After a while, Two-Eyes asked:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Three-Eyes, are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>But then she made a mistake, and instead of saying &ldquo;Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?&rdquo; she said:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>So now only two eyes were sleeping, and the third was not. And that third eye saw how Two-Eyes walked to the goat and said something to it, and then suddenly a table stood in the pasture with apple fritters and chocolate cakes on it and a big glass of milk.</p>
		<p>When Two-Eyes had finished everything, she woke Three-Eyes, and together with the goat, they walked home.</p>
		<p>----</p>
		<p>At home, Three-Eyes immediately ran to her mother and told her what she had seen.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;so my own daughter is fooling me! She cooks potatoes and vegetables for us while the lady eats apple fritters and chocolate cakes herself. I&rsquo;ll teach her!&rdquo; She grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer and slaughtered the goat.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The next day, Two-Eyes was sitting in the garden and crying bitterly. Suddenly, the old woman appeared before her again. &ldquo;Why are you crying, girl?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;They killed the goat,&rdquo; the girl said between sobs.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry anymore. Bury the goat in the front yard, and you&rsquo;ll see something wonderful,&rdquo; said the old woman, and she was gone again. When evening came, Two-Eyes buried the goat in the front yard. What is that good for? she thought...</p>
		<p>The next morning, a tree with silver leaves stood in that spot, and between those leaves hung golden apples. The mother and the two sisters were delighted. They didn&rsquo;t understand where that tree had suddenly come from, but they didn&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>One-Eye and Three-Eyes climbed the tree to pick the golden apples. But that didn&rsquo;t work because every time they reached for an apple, the branch would whip away. After a quarter of an hour, they hadn&rsquo;t been able to pick a single apple, and the tree was full of them!</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Two-Eyes saw that and asked if she could try. &ldquo;Hahaha,&rdquo; the mother said mockingly, &ldquo;if they can&rsquo;t do it, what can you do? But go ahead, give it a try.&rdquo; Two-Eyes climbed the tree and picked one apple after another. The mother and her two sisters were speechless.</p>
		<p>And who happened to ride by just as Two-Eyes climbed out of the tree? A prince on a white horse. He stopped to admire the silver tree. The mother quickly covered Two-Eyes with a rain barrel because, well, she looked so ordinary, and she was ashamed of it.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I would like a branch from that beautiful tree,&rdquo; said the prince politely.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But of course, Your Highness!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Quickly, Three-Eyes, climb the tree and break off a branch for His Highness.&rdquo; Three-Eyes climbed the tree, but again, every branch whipped aside just as she tried to grab one. It was the same with One-Eye.</p>
		<p>When the mother saw that the prince wanted to ride on, she quickly said, &ldquo;I have another daughter who can try.&rdquo; And she pulled Two-Eyes from under the rain barrel. Two-Eyes climbed the tree, took a branch, broke it off, and handed it to the prince.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear beautiful girl,&rdquo; said the prince.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>Two-Eyes couldn&rsquo;t believe her ears! Did the prince just say she was lovely and beautiful? No one had ever said that to her before! She turned red.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You may make a wish,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;and I will try to fulfill it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I only get leftovers to eat here,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I wish someone would take me away from here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fulfill your wish right away,&rdquo; said the prince. He lifted her onto his horse and rode away to his castle, where he married her a few weeks later.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p>The mother and the two sisters watched them go with open mouths. For a moment, they were quite grumpy, realizing they would have to cook and clean for themselves from now on. And then they thought how lucky they were to still have that wonderful silver tree with its golden apples.</p>
		<p>But the next day, the tree had disappeared, and they never discovered where it had gone.</p>
		<p>And what did Two-Eyes see the next day when she looked out of her castle window? Yes, a silver tree with golden apples! It had simply moved in with her.</p>

			<p>**A Long, Long Time Ago**</p>
			<p>Once upon a time, far away from here, there lived a poor boy who lived alone in a tiny hut. All he had was a little chicken, which he loved very much. During the day, it would roam around the yard, and at night, when it got cold, it would sleep close to the boy in bed.</p>
			<p>But the little chicken was old, and one day it died...</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The boy was very sad. He dug a hole in the woods to bury the chicken. Just then, two old men passed by, offering him three coins for the dead chicken.</p>
			<p>The boy found it strange&mdash;three coins for a dead chicken&mdash;but money is money, and he was poor. He thought about it for a moment and was about to say, "Yes, that's fine," when an old woman&mdash;perhaps a fairy&mdash;whispered in his ear that he shouldn't do that. They were two wicked wizards, she said, and they only wanted the chicken because there was a red magic stone in its beak.</p>
			<p>So the boy quickly said "no" to the two old men and ran home with his chicken under his arm. There, he indeed found a red stone in its beak.</p>
			<p>It looked like an ordinary red stone. There was nothing special about it. The boy examined it from all sides. What do you do with a magic stone? And more importantly, what kind of wonders could it perform? He shook it back and forth. He tapped it. He turned it three times. Nothing happened. He rubbed it, and then...</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Suddenly, he heard a voice saying, "Whatever you wish for, you shall receive. Just say what you want."</p>
			<p>"I want my chicken to be alive again," said the boy quickly.</p>
			<p>And there the chicken lifted its head, stretched its legs, and started to roam around again.</p>
			<p>"And I want a nice bowl of soup," said the boy. And there it was, a bowl of steaming bean soup right in front of him.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>"And a basket of corn kernels for the chicken, because she loves those." And there stood a basket full of corn kernels.</p>
			<p>"And I want a big house," said the boy.</p>
			<p>And the tiny hut transformed into a big house. "Now I want a chest full of money," said the boy. And sure enough, in the corner of the room stood a large chest filled with gold coins.</p>
			<p>Now there was no stopping him. He wished for everything: a big bed, a soft mattress, a down blanket, a thick carpet, you name it. Within half an hour, he had a palace, ten closets full of expensive clothes, a stable with thirty horses, and a retinue of servants.</p>
			<p>Now he just needed a beautiful wife, he thought, and then he would have everything he wanted. He had one of his many servants pour a glass of fresh lemonade and sent him to the king's palace to say that he wanted to marry the princess. The king was surprised. Just like that, someone wanted to marry his daughter? What was that man thinking?</p>
			<p>The servant told the king that his master was very rich, perhaps even richer than the king himself, but that wasn&rsquo;t enough for the king.</p>
			<p>"He may be rich," he said to his daughter, "but I still want to see what kind of person he is."</p>
			<p>But the princess thought that was unnecessary. He was very rich, and that was enough for her. The father hesitated, but then the princess got angry. She stomped her feet and shouted that she wanted to marry him and she wanted it TOMORROW!</p>
			<p>Now the king loved his daughter very much, and so he gave in to her wishes.</p>
			<p>Very foolish of him, for she had been a darling as a little girl, but now she was a spoiled brat. But that's just how some fathers are.</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>First, the golden times began for her, as her new husband spoiled her even more than the king did. She got everything she wanted, and she wanted a lot: dresses, bags, shoes, even more dresses, even more bags, even more shoes. It never ended.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the two wicked wizards were not idle and had discovered that the boy with the dead chicken was now married to the princess. They still wanted that red stone, so they came up with a plan. They made a special doll&mdash;one that could dance, talk, and bow. The doll was so special that the princess soon heard about it and of course wanted it immediately. But the two wizards only wanted to trade. And for the red stone.</p>
			<p>"The red stone?" asked the princess. "What red stone?" "The stone that your husband always wears on a silk cord around his neck," they said.</p>
			<p>That evening, in bed, the princess said she wanted to wear the stone for a while. Her husband didn't want to deal with another shouting match, so the next day, the princess gave the stone to the wizards and got the doll in return.</p>
			<p>The wizards hurried home to their house in the woods, where they rubbed the stone and wished for the boy to lose everything he had ever wished for. So the boy suddenly became poor again and lived in his tiny hut.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>And the princess? She was furious. She screamed that she had always thought he was a ZERO, and that she was NOW going back to her father and that she NEVER wanted to see him again. The boy was left alone and very unhappy.</p>
			<p>He realized that the wizards had the stone and decided to search for them in the woods, where he had first encountered them. He wasted no time and set off immediately.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>By evening, he was dead tired and sat under a large oak tree. Suddenly, he heard a small voice. "Why do you look so sad?"</p>
			<p>The boy looked around but saw no one.</p>
			<p>"Why do you look so sad?" he heard again. It was a little forest mouse.</p>
			<p>"Oh," said the boy, and he told the whole sad story. "Actually, you have this all to blame on yourself," said the forest mouse, "but never mind, I will help you. I know where the wizards live."</p>
			<p>They hid behind the ferns in front of the wizards' house. They waited until evening fell and all the lights went out. Then the forest mouse whispered, "Now they are sleeping."</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>He crawled under the front door to search for the stone.</p>
			<p>In the bedroom, he saw something sparkling in the moonlight. It was the stone, set in a ring, which was on the finger of one of the snoring wizards. When the forest mouse tried to get the ring off the finger, he accidentally bit the finger itself. The wizard woke up and mumbled, "That ring is too tight!" He took it off and placed it on the nightstand.</p>
			<p>A little later, the mouse was outside again and had the boy's stone back. "I wished for the wrong things," said the boy to himself. "All that wealth has not brought me happiness. I must approach this differently."</p>
			<p>He rubbed the ring and said, "I wish for two donkeys, with which I can earn my own bread, and nothing more. Oh yes, just one more thing. I wish for my little chicken to be a sweet girl whom I can marry."</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>And so it happened. They lived happily ever after. But the girl baked corn cakes very often...</p>

			<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who had three sons. He was quite satisfied with the two oldest boys, but he thought his youngest son was quite foolish, and so he called him for convenience "Fool." Just imagine, being called "Fool" all day long!</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>One day, the woodcutter fell ill, so ill that he had to stay in bed. Since he couldn&rsquo;t go to the forest to chop wood, he sent his oldest son out. His mother gave the boy a delicious egg cake and a bottle of wine. He had hardly entered the forest when he saw an old crooked little man sitting on a tree stump. &ldquo;If you give me something to eat and drink,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;I will reward you.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>What could such an old crooked man reward me with? thought the oldest son. I&rsquo;ll keep that delicious egg cake and that bottle of wine for myself! And he walked further into the forest. There he chose a thick tree, but when he tried to chop it down, he accidentally hit his hand. In pain, he dropped the axe and ran home crying.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Now the second son had to go to the forest. His mother also baked him a delicious egg cake and he received a bottle of wine, and once he arrived in the forest, he too saw the old crooked man sitting there. &ldquo;If you give me something to eat and drink,&rdquo; said the little man again, &ldquo;I will reward you.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&ldquo;If I give you something, I&rsquo;ll have less for myself, so I&rsquo;ll keep that delicious egg cake and that bottle of wine for myself,&rdquo; said the second son. He also walked further into the forest and looked for a suitable tree to chop down, but guess what? The second son chopped into his foot and hobbled home groaning.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Then the youngest son said that he would go to the forest to chop wood.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re much too foolish for that, Fool!&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;If your brothers can&rsquo;t do it, then you certainly can&rsquo;t either!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>But the youngest son went anyway. His mother only gave him a dry crust of bread and a bottle of water from the well, and he was fine with that. With an axe over his shoulder, he whistled into the forest. Soon he saw the old crooked man sitting on the tree stump.&ldquo;If you give me something to eat and drink,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;I will reward you.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s not necessary,&rdquo; said the youngest son cheerfully. &ldquo;I have a crust of bread from my mother and a bottle of water from the well. We can share that together.&rdquo; The old man ate some of the crust of bread and drank from the bottle, and then said to the boy: &ldquo;Soon you will see a sick old tree that is so weak you won&rsquo;t even need to chop it down. If you push against it, it will fall over by itself. Among the roots, you will find a reward that you will enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Fool didn&rsquo;t have to walk far. Soon he saw an old tree that was completely gray. He pushed against the trunk and the tree fell over. And what did he see there among the roots? A goose!</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Fool could immediately see that it was no ordinary goose, because the creature shimmered and sparkled on all sides. He had never seen anything like it: the goose&rsquo;s feathers were made of gold!</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>By now it was almost dark, too late to go home, so the youngest son walked into an inn to spend the night. He was so tired that he went straight to bed and fell asleep right away.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Now the innkeeper had three daughters. The oldest daughter had seen the goose and thought: I would like to have a golden feather for my Sunday hat. The second daughter thought: I would like to have a golden feather for my new belt. And the youngest daughter thought: I would like to have a few golden feathers to put in my hair.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Around midnight, the oldest daughter tiptoed to Fool&rsquo;s room. The goose was sitting on a cabinet next to the bed. Carefully, the girl tried to pull a feather from its tail, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Instead, she got stuck to the goose to her shock! No matter how much she tugged and pulled&mdash;without making a noise, of course&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t get loose. A little later, the second daughter slipped into the room, also looking for a golden feather, and was very surprised to see her oldest sister standing there. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck,&rdquo; whispered the oldest daughter, &ldquo;pull me free, quickly please!&rdquo; The second daughter pulled at her sister's shoulder and&hellip; oh dear, she got stuck to her arm!</p>
			<p>Here came the youngest daughter already sneaking up. She pulled at the dress of the second daughter and&hellip; sure enough, she got stuck to the dress.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The next morning, Fool woke up and saw to his astonishment the three daughters standing there. &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;I knew there was something special about that goose.&rdquo; He took the animal under his arm and walked out the door, with the three girls following behind him.</p>
			<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to be in that situation at all, so they did everything they could to get free from the goose and from each other, but it didn&rsquo;t work. They had to come along, whether they wanted to or not.</p>
			<p>They hadn&rsquo;t even left the village when they encountered the pastor. &ldquo;Leave that boy alone!&rdquo; he said sternly to the girls. He tried to pull the youngest daughter free, but&hellip; he got stuck to her sleeve.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Just outside the village, the sexton came walking along. &ldquo;But Mr. Pastor,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;where are you going? We have a wedding soon, and we need to go to church.&rdquo; He grabbed the pastor by the sleeve and&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t get loose either.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Fortunately, two farmers came by just then. &ldquo;Hey there,&rdquo; shouted the sexton, &ldquo;please pull us loose!&rdquo; One farmer pulled on the sexton&rsquo;s jacket, the second farmer pulled on the first farmer&rsquo;s pants, and&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;they both got stuck.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>And off they went, in a long line behind each other: Fool, the three daughters of the innkeeper, the pastor, the sexton, and lastly the two farmers.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>And if only they had walked calmly, but no, they shoved, pulled, bumped, and kicked against each other to break free. Meanwhile, they shouted at Fool to stop, but Fool walked on whistling, as if nothing were happening.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Thus they passed the king&rsquo;s palace. The gatekeeper, seeing the procession approach, began to laugh heartily. &ldquo;You definitely have to stop by the king&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t laughed in three years, and the king is desperate. Whoever makes her laugh gets to marry her, he said.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>Fool didn&rsquo;t think twice. He walked with the three girls, the pastor, the sexton, and the two farmers over the drawbridge to the palace, where the princess sat sadly behind the window. When she saw the strange procession entering the garden, she had to smile a little, and as Fool came closer, she began to roar with laughter.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The king was so pleased that Fool could marry the princess that very day. And they lived happily ever after. So it was a good thing that Fool, who was now called Prince, was so generous and kind; otherwise, he would still be at home with his father, who called him &ldquo;Fool&rdquo; all day long. You&rsquo;d rather be married to a princess, wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

			<p>Once upon a time, a long, long time ago and far away from here, there lived an old poor shepherd. Besides a daughter and a son, he had a little house and three sheep, and nothing else. One day, he fell very ill and died...</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>After they buried their father, the son asked his sister, &ldquo;What do you want, the house or the three sheep?&rdquo; The girl chose the house.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, that works out well,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;because I always wanted to see something of the world. This is my chance.&rdquo; He took the three sheep out of the pen, walked off the yard, and set out.</p>
			<p>After walking for hours and hours, he came across a man who had three large black dogs with him. &ldquo;What beautiful sheep you have there,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Shall we trade, you my dogs and I your sheep?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Dogs need food, and I don&rsquo;t have a red cent. Sheep find their own food.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Just do it,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;because these are three wonder dogs. The biggest one is named Salt. If you want something to eat, he&rsquo;ll fetch it for you. The second is named Pepper; he&rsquo;s a champion fighter. And the third is Mustard. He can break iron with his jaws.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Well, such special dogs the boy wanted! So soon after, he walked on, now with three dogs instead of three sheep following him.</p>
			<p>The road went uphill, and the landscape grew grim. Dark clouds drifted low over the black mountains. It was eerily quiet. You could only hear the wind.</p>
			<p>Behind the boy, a pitch-black carriage came rolling in. Everything about it was black&mdash;the driver was dressed in black, the two horses were black, and even the reins were made of black leather. Inside the carriage sat a beautiful girl&mdash;also completely dressed in black. She was crying.</p>
			<p>The boy stepped into the middle of the road and stopped the carriage. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why is everything and everyone in black? And who is that girl, and why is she crying so much?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business,&rdquo; growled the driver. &ldquo;Get out of the way, you!&rdquo; And he lashed the whip at the boy.</p>
			<p>The girl leaned out of the window. &ldquo;I am the king&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not get involved. Do you see that cave over there? A dreadful dragon lives there. He demands a girl to eat every year. If he doesn&rsquo;t get one, he destroys the whole land. Now it&rsquo;s my turn to be eaten.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The girl sat back down, and the carriage continued on.</p>
			<p>Well, the boy felt very sorry for the princess. So, he ran after the carriage, and when it stopped, he went inside the cave with his three dogs, following the princess. It was so dark inside that at first, they couldn&rsquo;t see anything. From the darkness in front of them came a heavy, deep growl. And suddenly, there stood the dragon! He spread his wings wide, clawed at the rocky floor, opened his mouth wide, and&hellip;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Pepper!&rdquo; shouted the boy. &ldquo;Get him!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Pepper jumped at the dragon&rsquo;s throat and bit down hard. Blood sprayed everywhere. The dragon roared and swung his head back and forth in fury to shake the dog off. He tried to tear Pepper apart with his claws, but that didn&rsquo;t work at all. The boy and the princess had to be careful not to get hit by the swinging tail, but eventually, after a long battle, the dragon fell down dead.</p>
			<p>The princess hugged the boy and said he must come with her to her father. Because the king had said that whoever saved his daughter from the dragon could marry her.</p>
			<p>The boy said, &ldquo;I would like to marry you, but not yet. I want to see more of the world first. I will come back in three years.&rdquo; He gave her a kiss and left.</p>
			<p>The driver, who had heard the roaring, had stayed safely outside and now saw the princess come out of the cave alive and well. She got into the carriage, and they began their journey back. On a bridge high above a wide river, the driver stopped and threateningly said to the princess, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell your father that I saved you. Then you will marry me. You promise me now that you will never tell him the truth, or I will throw you into the river right now.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The princess looked into the depths. What could she do but promise, for she couldn&rsquo;t swim...</p>
			<p>At home, the king embraced his daughter. He was overjoyed to see her alive and said, &ldquo;I said that your savior can marry you. The wedding is the day after tomorrow.&rdquo; And he patted the driver approvingly on the shoulder. The princess could, of course, not say that the driver hadn&rsquo;t saved her at all, because she had promised, and a princess always keeps her promises. But she did come up with a trick.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still too young to marry, father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s postpone it for a year.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The driver naturally didn&rsquo;t want to hear of it, but the king thought his daughter was still a bit too young and postponed the wedding.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>After a year, the princess said, &ldquo;Father, I still feel too young to marry. Let&rsquo;s postpone it for another year.&rdquo; The driver was beside himself with anger, but the king agreed with his daughter.</p>
			<p>The next year, the princess said for the third time that she was too young to marry. But now the king said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;ll postpone it for one more year, but then I don&rsquo;t want to hear of any more postponements. Because I promised your savior.&rdquo; Yes... and then the next year came. And yes... now the princess had to marry. On the appointed day, there was a celebration throughout the land. The bells rang, the people danced in the streets, and everyone was joyful. Except for the princess, of course. She sat sadly next to the driver at the feast. She could only hope that the boy with the dogs would keep his word. After all, he was supposed to return after three years, right?</p>
			<p>She did not know that he had just arrived in the city at that moment. He saw all those happy people and asked why there was a celebration.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Three years ago, the princess was rescued from the dragon by a driver,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;and today they are getting married.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That man is a liar!&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;I saved her!&rdquo; But the people didn&rsquo;t believe him and got angry. The guards even had to get involved because it was forbidden to quarrel on this festive day.</p>
			<p>The boy was thrown into prison along with his dogs. When they were alone, the boy said to Mustard, &ldquo;Mustard, bite through the bars!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>That was done in no time. After some gnawing and cracking, the boy sneaked out of the prison, and the dogs followed him. He hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything since that morning and was now very hungry. &ldquo;Salt,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;go get something to eat for me!&rdquo; And off went Salt.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The dog went into the royal banquet hall and grabbed a roasted chicken from the royal table. The princess recognized the dog, jumped up, and ran after him.</p>
			<p>She found the boy a street away and took him back to the palace. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is my savior. Not that stupid driver.&rdquo; And then she told everything.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>The wedding went ahead, but now with the boy as the groom instead of the driver.</p>
			<p>And what happened to the driver? He went to prison. And the dogs? They suddenly disappeared without a trace, and no one knew where they had gone.</p>
			<p>Is there a lesson to be learned from this fairy tale? <br />Yes! Get your swimming diploma!</p>

			<p>LONG, LONG AGO, in a land very far away, there was a rich man who was called Bluebeard. His hair was just black on his head, and his mustache and thick eyebrows were pitch black too, but his beard was truly completely blue. He lived far away in a dark castle that had more than seventy rooms and was thus far too large for just him. That was also the reason why he was looking for a wife, or rather: he was looking for a wife again, for he had been married a few times before. What had happened to those women, nobody knew...</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>So when he once saw a beautiful girl walking, he visited her father and asked if he could marry the girl. The father thought, If this rich man marries my daughter, perhaps I will get some of his money and become rich myself. Well, he was very much in favor of it, so he didn&rsquo;t hesitate for a second and said immediately: 'Yes!' He didn&rsquo;t even ask his daughter what she thought! Maybe on purpose, because he could clearly see that she was a bit scared of Bluebeard. And that wasn&rsquo;t so strange, for Bluebeard had eerie eyes and a bad temper.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>No one had ever seen him laugh, and then there was of course that strange blue beard...</p>
			<p>The wedding was celebrated, but before the girl left for the castle with the seventy rooms, she quickly whispered to her three brothers: 'If you hear me screaming for help, come to me immediately!' The brothers promised this, and with a knot in her stomach, the girl got into the carriage. It was three days of driving through dense forests and misty swamps, and then the girl found herself alone with Bluebeard in the big gloomy castle, far away from everything and everyone.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>A month later, Bluebeard unexpectedly had to go on a journey. He gave her a large bunch of keys. 'Here are the keys to all the rooms,' he said. 'You may go anywhere, except for one room. This little key is for a room in the cellar, and that's the only space you must not enter. The door is red, so you can't be mistaken. If you do look in that room, I will punish you severely.' After these words, Bluebeard mounted his horse and left.</p>
			<p>The girl was curious and immediately tried all the keys. She didn't know that there were so many kinds of rooms &ndash; one had red wallpaper, another green, the third had a marble floor, and the fourth had expensive tapestries on the walls. Every day she saw new rooms, walked through new hallways. Up and down the stairs she went, and suddenly, before she realized it, she found herself in the cellar in front of the forbidden red door...</p>
			<p>It was not a big door; in fact, it was quite an ordinary door. She felt the rough wood and the large black hinges. How strange it was that she wasn't allowed in there. That evening she couldn't fall asleep. She kept thinking about that room. What was in there? Why wasn't she allowed to know?</p>
			<p>Fortunately, her sister Anna came to stay, so she could think of something else, and together the sisters wandered through the castle. They looked at all the rooms, but the girl said nothing about the room in the cellar.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>On the day before Bluebeard was to return home, she could no longer suppress her curiosity. When her sister Anna took an afternoon nap, she grabbed the little key and tiptoed down the stairs to the cellar. For quite some time she stood with her heart pounding in front of the red door, the little key trembling in her hand. I'm just going to push against it a little, the girl thought, maybe it&rsquo;s not even locked. But the door was locked...</p>
			<p>I'm just going to try if the key fits, the girl thought, you never know, maybe it&rsquo;s the wrong key. But the key fit perfectly... And if I just turn it a little... She held her breath as the door slowly and creakingly opened.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>It was quite dark inside. She took a step into the room and screamed in fright. There were all coffins! The girl wanted to quickly leave the room but dropped the key. She quickly picked it up, and in an instant, she had closed the door behind her and locked it.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Back in her bedroom, she saw to her horror that there was blood on the key. No matter how much she scrubbed and cleaned with soap and a steel brush, it wouldn&rsquo;t come off! She wrapped it in a handkerchief and hid it far away in a deep drawer. Tomorrow Bluebeard would come home, and what if he asked for the little key...</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The girl didn't know what to do! All night long she walked back and forth, back and forth through the room.<br />Early the next morning she heard the outer gate open. Heavy steps sounded in the hallway and a moment later he was standing in front of her. The girl was so scared that she immediately burst into tears. Bluebeard understood immediately what was going on. The bunch of keys was on the table and the small key was not there&hellip; &lsquo;You have been in the cellar,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;so now I must punish you. I warned you!&rsquo; He drew his sword and was about to stab her to death, but the girl dropped to her knees and begged to be allowed to pray in her room. &lsquo;Two minutes and not a second longer,&rsquo; said Bluebeard. The girl ran up the stairs &ndash; not to her own room, but to her sister<br />Anna's room. There she called out of the window: &lsquo;Oh dear, dear brothers, where are you? Help me, help me!&rsquo; The brothers heard this, who happened to be riding their horses nearby. They immediately turned around and galloped to the castle.</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the girl said to her sister, &ldquo;Quickly, sister Anna, climb to the highest tower and see if you can see them coming!&rdquo; Anna gathered her skirts and ran up the winding staircase. The girl herself stayed in the room and quickly slid the bolt across the door.</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The two minutes are almost up!&rdquo; Bluebeard called impatiently from below. The girl shouted anxiously upward, &ldquo;Sister Anna, sister Anna, do you see anything coming?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And from high up in the tower, Anna called down, &ldquo;I see nothing, only trees and a dark sky.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The two minutes are over!&rdquo; roared Bluebeard.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>----</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Oh Anna, Sister Anna, do you see nothing coming?&rsquo; the girl cried again in a trembling voice.<br />&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; Anna cried back, &lsquo;I see only mountains and black clouds.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Come down now, or I will come and fetch you!&rsquo; shouted Bluebeard.<br />&lsquo;Anna, oh Anna, do you still see nothing coming?&rsquo; the girl cried now, weeping.<br />&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; Anna cried cheeringly, &lsquo;I see a cloud of dust, which is fast approaching.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Now I will come and fetch you,&rsquo; roared Bluebeard, and he stormed up the stairs with his sword.<br />He cut a hole in the door and squeezed his way in. In three steps he was at the girl and with both hands he raised his sword, ready to stab her to death.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>At that moment the three brothers burst in and stabbed Bluebeard to death. The girl threw her arms around her brothers, crying. She was saved! That was what you call the nick of time. The girl was now very rich, but she would not continue to live in the castle for anything. She bought another castle (one without a cellar), which may not have been as big, but much more pleasant.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>---</p>
			<p>You surely understand now who lay in those coffins: the girls Bluebeard had married before, all of whom had been just as curious as the girl in this story! So it is a miracle that this story ends so well. But the one who truly deserved a good beating was the girl's father.</p>
